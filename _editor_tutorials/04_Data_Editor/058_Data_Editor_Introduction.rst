DATA EDITOR INTRODUCTION
========================

The Data Editor houses all of the data assets in the Editor. Every piece
of a project’s data is built using the basic types found here. It is a
deep and powerful system that offers users a great deal of control, the
most ever seen in a Blizzard editing suite.

Data Editor in Use

Inside the Data Editor you’ll find a robust feature set supporting its
editing functionality. You should note that data will update dynamically
while you work, allowing changes to propagate quickly throughout the
whole project. There are also several visualization options offering an
overview of any data construct. These are great for building a tactile
sense of how the engine operates. Perhaps most importantly, all of
StarCraft’s assets are made available and can be viewed through the Data
Editor. Here you can examine them closely and learn from them, or
repurpose them for use in your own mods.

DATA CATALOGS
-------------

Data in the Editor is organized into Catalogs, each containing a list of
every instance of a specific data type currently active in the project.
You must navigate to a specific data type’s catalog to create or manage
any data of that specific type. Each catalog provides a view of all the
data fields of its associated type, as well as some context appropriate
options. There are 87 catalogs in total in the Data Editor, though most
users will find that their work concentrated in a small fraction of
them. Most of that 87-catalog count is made up by highly specific types
of data, many of which you’ll seldom use.

Some examples of catalogs include familiar game types like Abilities and
Units, and art assets like Models and Sound. Some of the more specific
types mentioned above include Physics Materials, Cursors, and
Achievements. You’ll find a full list of the engine’s catalogs below
this paragraph. It’s worth noting that the catalogs are organized into
broad categories, such as Game Data or Actor Data, to reflect the
different purposes of different data types.

THE INTERFACE

Data Editor Interface View

You can navigate the Data Editor’s catalogs using the Catalog Tabs,
shown below.

.. figure:: ./058_Data_Editor_Introduction/image3.png
   :alt: Image

   Image

Catalog Tabs

Each catalog has an associated tab that gives access to their data
listings. You can bring the tab into a project using the green,
plus-sign shaped Catalog Opener. Once you have selected a tab, it will
populate the catalog’s data in the Object List, as shown below.

.. figure:: ./058_Data_Editor_Introduction/image4.png
   :alt: Image

   Image

Object List

This list organizes the entire data catalog based on several context
sensitive properties, such as Source, ID #, Object Family, and Race. As
you can see in the image below, the full hierarchy of a data structure
is displayed for the selected instance within the Object Explorer.

.. figure:: ./058_Data_Editor_Introduction/image5.png
   :alt: Image

   Image

Object Explorer

For higher level constructs like Units, this explorer offers a crucial
top-down look at all of the contents of a piece of data. Any piece of
data in the Object Explorer or Object List will display its data fields
in the Fields Listing, as shown below.

.. figure:: ./058_Data_Editor_Introduction/image6.png
   :alt: Image

   Image

Fields Listing

The Fields Listing is the data entry segment of the Data Editor. Here
data can be altered directly through user input. Since there is so much
variety in the types of catalogs and fields available for editing, there
is a selection of viewing options to make the listing as accessible as
possible. You’ll find these in the Data Bar.

These options include the structured Fields Listing views: Table View,
Detail View, and XML View. These are shown below.

Table View - Detail View – XML View

These viewing options are also accessible from the View Tab of the Data
Editor.

.. figure:: ./058_Data_Editor_Introduction/image9.png
   :alt: Image

   Image

View Tab

There are different options available in each layer. You can access them
from the large panel on the leftmost side of the main terrain view. This
is called the UI Panel.

The **UI Panel** changes depending on your current layer; each layer has
a Palette that offers most of the major controls for that layer. These
Palettes are geared specifically for use in the current layer. You
should also note that the top File Tab offers many options. These are
broken down into subtabs, which are described in the following sections.

SUBEDITORS
----------

In some cases, you’ll find that there are more specialized, nested
editors available during field editing. These Subeditors include the
Actor Events Editor, the Footprints Editor, and the Sound Editor. These
are shown in the image below.

DATA VISUALIZATION
------------------

As the data structures within your project grow and are woven together,
it can be useful to have some visualization options so that you can get
a better look at what your project is doing. The Data Editor offers a
few options for this, most notably the Data Navigator shown below.

.. figure:: ./058_Data_Editor_Introduction/image11.png
   :alt: Image

   Image

Data Navigator

The navigator draws the links between each piece of data, presenting the
entire instance’s data hierarchy in a readable manner. Another useful
provision is the Show Explain Link option available for use with the
Object Explorer. This will display a simpler version of the data
connections to an output panel, as shown in the image below.
