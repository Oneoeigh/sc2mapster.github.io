<h1 id="set-up-a-first-person-camera">SET UP A FIRST PERSON CAMERA</h1>

<p>Camera objects in the StarCraft engine are devices often used for
storytelling. Applying a new camera during a narrative scene allows you
to use angles and effects outside the traditional isometric view. A
quick switch of the camera can be a very potent narrative tool.</p>

<p>Custom cameras can also be applied to gameplay itself, altering the
player’s viewpoint to a new perspective while they play. A favorite use
of this technique for many developers is the First Person Camera. This
is a camera set directly inside the head of a game’s player character. A
first person camera simulates a natural viewpoint of walking or moving
around the environment and gives the user the impression that they are
navigating the game themselves. Making this alteration to the engine’s
gameplay camera is quite straightforward. Follow the method laid out in
this article and the map provided with it to set up a first person
camera for any project.</p>

<h2 id="field-of-view">FIELD OF VIEW</h2>

<p>The Field of View (FOV) sets how much of the game world is visible to a
camera. This an important figure for controlling the basic composition
of a custom gameplay camera. Changing the FOV can be tricky and is best
done through a live preview of a camera. There are actually two types of
field of view available for use in the Editor, Vertical and Horizontal.
A Vertical FOV is used by default, as it is more appropriate for a
traditional RTS view.</p>

<p>For a first person camera, you should strongly consider a Horizontal
FOV, as it tends to give a much more natural approximation of human
eyesight. The field of view type can be changed in map properties by
navigating to Map Options -&gt; Options -&gt; Use Horizontal Field of View.
Checking this flag will change the FOV type of every camera to
Horizontal. You should note that certain FOV values are a common cause
of motion sickness amongst players. Having an in-game control to change
the magnitude of the FOV value can be helpful.</p>

<p>Enabling Horizontal Field of View</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-camera">CREATING THE CAMERA</h2>

<p>A first person camera should be oriented on the map alongside the player
character in a fashion that would simulate that character’s vision. You
can do this by moving the camera effectively into the character model’s
head, or just behind their shoulders. The Free Camera Controls are
crucial here, as they allow you to position the Editor camera easily
with the mouse. The following controls are particularly useful for
setting the camera.</p>

<hr />
<p>Control       Effect
  ————- ———————————————————
  Zoom          Zooms the camera in the target direction. Zooming in will
                decrease camera Distance.</p>

<p>(Shift +    <br />
  Right Click)</p>

<p>Rotate        Spins the camera around its target point. This will alter
                Target – Pitch and Target - Yaw.</p>

<p>(Ctrl + Right 
  Click)</p>

<p>Height        Moves the camera along a vertical axis, away from or
                closer to the map’s ground level. This alters Target – Z
                Offset.</p>

<p>(Alt + Right<br />
  Click)      <br />
  ———————————————————————–</p>

<p>A placed first person camera should look something like the image below.</p>

<p><img src="./089_Set_Up_a_First_Person_Camera/image6.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>First Person Camera Setting</p>

<p>Once oriented, the camera object can be created by hitting the ‘Create
Camera’ button in the Cameras Palette, as shown below. Note that the
unit model’s blocking the view is only temporary. You should also make
sure to get an idea of the unit’s position relative to the camera, as
this will be the anchor for the first person camera’s movement.</p>

<p><img src="./089_Set_Up_a_First_Person_Camera/image7.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Creating Camera Object</p>

<h2 id="choosing-camera-properties">CHOOSING CAMERA PROPERTIES</h2>

<p>You can use ‘Camera Properties’ to preview the camera object and fine
tune how it will look in game. Open this pane by selecting the first
person camera from the Cameras Palette, then double clicking it. The
standard first person camera settings are shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./089_Set_Up_a_First_Person_Camera/image8.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>First Person Camera Property Settings</p>

<p>There are several things you should take note of here. The basic camera
shot target is composed of the Pitch and Yaw. These values will vary
widely depending on a camera’s position on the map. Typically, you’ll
need to use a Z Offset in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 to give a realistic
ground-level view.</p>

<p>Distance in this case controls the separation of the camera and its
target. For a first person camera it should be set to 0. A (Horizontal)
Field of View set to 90 is the most common option for making a
good-looking first person perspective. You should also set the Distance
Far Clip to 10,000. This large distance will cause some performance
dragging, but it is necessary to render the entirety of the scene from
such a low, flat vantage.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-the-camera-logic">SETTING UP THE CAMERA LOGIC</h2>

<p>A custom gameplay camera will require handling logic, triggers that
handle how the camera will perform and be used by the player during game
time. Logic like this can take on many forms depending on the type of
project and its implementation. Still, there are some basic necessities
that will likely be a part of any design. A standard example of first
person camera logic is shown in the image below.</p>

<p><img src="./089_Set_Up_a_First_Person_Camera/image9.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>First Person Camera Logic</p>

<p>Each step of the camera logic is annotated below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reveal Area – The map has been revealed, as RTS-style fog of war is
not desirable here.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->
<ul>
  <li>Set Variable – Sets the controllable player character, which serves
as the camera anchor.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->
<ul>
  <li>Apply Camera Object – Applies the first person camera to the
in-game view.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->
<ul>
  <li>Follow Unit Group with Camera Area – Attaches the first person
camera to the player’s movements.</li>
  <li>Lock Camera Mouse Relative Mode On – Ties camera movement to mouse
control, which is a genre standard.</li>
  <li>Turn Camera Rotation On – Supports the mouse control by allowing
the camera to free-look in 3D space.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->
<ul>
  <li>Hide the Mouse Cursor – Removes the player cursor from view.</li>
  <li>Hide the Game UI – Removes the standard UI, allowing for a custom
build.</li>
</ul>

<p>Together, these actions help complete the illusion that the camera is
actually a free moving entity. Combining this with any sort of keyboard
controls for movement will form the basis of a first person game.</p>

<h2 id="camera-smooth-time">CAMERA SMOOTH TIME</h2>

<p>The game camera has some built-in smoothing coefficients that affect how
the camera moves around the map. When you’re building a first person
camera, the default values tend to be detrimental. You can change those
defaults by moving to the Data Editor, then to the Cameras tab, as shown
below.</p>

<p><img src="./089_Set_Up_a_First_Person_Camera/image10.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Camera Smooth Time Settings</p>

<p>You can change these values by opening the ‘Target Smooth’ field. You’ll
want to alter the Smooth Time Maximum and Smooth Time Minimum values.
These set the minimum time the camera can take while moving to the
position of a moving target. Setting these values too low may cause
stuttering, so a standard value of 0.08 is usually appropriate. The
completed fields are shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./089_Set_Up_a_First_Person_Camera/image11.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Setting Smooth Times</p>

<h2 id="hiding-the-player-unit">HIDING THE PLAYER UNIT</h2>

<p>For a first person game, the player character’s model should be removed
from view. This is accomplished in the unit actor’s events by adding an
ActorCreation event that sends the SetOpacity message, setting the
model’s opacity to 0.0. You can see this in the following image.</p>

<p><img src="./089_Set_Up_a_First_Person_Camera/image12.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Set Opacity Actor Message</p>

<h2 id="testing-the-results">TESTING THE RESULTS</h2>

<p>In the demo map provided with this article, all of the listed
modifications have already been made to the game. Testing it should give
you the following result.</p>
