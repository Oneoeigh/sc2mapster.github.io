<h1 id="records">RECORDS</h1>

<p>Records are templates of variables. Building a record is like assembling
a sort of planned layout of variables, where you decide type, name, and
quantity. Once assembled, the record defines a new composite data type
that can be created indefinitely. Each record creates a set of variables
according to its design, then maintains them as a persistent container.
A typical record design is shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./040_Records/image1.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Record Anatomy</p>

<p>The record design belies its main usage, the top heading ‘Tutorial
Record’ is the name of the record. Since the record itself is never used
to store variables, this name will become a makeshift type for the
record. When instances of the record are made, they will show the record
type, in this case Tutorial Record, as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./040_Records/image2.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Record Instances</p>

<p>Under the ‘Variables’ heading are the variables contained with the
record, referred to as ‘members.’ Each member has its own type and
initial value. When you create an instance of Tutorial Record, it will
create each of its members, meaning that the instance will have five
members of the type, Name, Player, Color, Race, and Starting Location,
each with their respective data type.</p>

<h2 id="creating-records">CREATING RECORDS</h2>

<p>Records are created in the Triggers Panel, as they must exist at a
global scope. Right-click on the panel and navigate to New -&gt; New
Record. Selecting the record will display its contents in the main view
tab. Record variables can be created by right-clicking on the
‘Variables’ heading in the record and navigating to New -&gt; New
Variable. To create a new instance of a record, create a variable and
set its type to – Record. This will make a listing of any possible
record types available under the heading ‘Record.’ Once you have
selected the desired type, each variable within the record will
automatically be created, though not directly visible in the Editor.</p>

<p><img src="./040_Records/image3.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Record Instances</p>

<p>Note that records, as in the data type, show up in the Triggers Panel,
suggesting a global scope. However, since they are not actual instances,
they have no specific scope yet. Individual instances of a record can
exist at either a global or local scope.</p>

<h2 id="referencing-a-record-variable">REFERENCING A RECORD VARIABLE</h2>

<p>The variables created within a record instance are not directly
accessible. They cannot be altered or inspected with the same methods
that traditional variables can be. In terms of use, record variables
must be accessed through a technique known as referencing. This allows
you to call on the individual variable by referencing it in terms of the
record instance. Consider the following record.</p>

<p><img src="./040_Records/image4.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Record with Integer Members</p>

<p>An instance of this record type has been created called Player Data. In
this instance there is a Starting Minerals variable like its source
record. As an exercise, try setting a player’s minerals to this Starting
Minerals count of 500 at the start of a game. This will require you to
reference the record instance’s property. Fortunately, the Editor GUI
does much of the work here. Imagine you were going to use a ‘Modify
Player Property’ action, as in the following trigger.</p>

<p><img src="./040_Records/image5.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Trigger Requiring Referenced Variable</p>

<p>The ‘Value’ field is where the Starting Minerals variable is needed, but
it is unclear how to deliver it there. Double click the field to launch
an ‘Integer’ window and navigate to the Variable tab as seen below.</p>

<p><img src="./040_Records/image6.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Integer Field Window</p>

<p>The record instance is shown in the field viewer. Since there is an
integer type variable inside this record, it is made available as an
input to the field. Select it and click ‘Ok.’ You’ll see that some
changes have been made to the ‘Value’ field for the action, as shown
below.</p>

<p><img src="./040_Records/image7.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>New Action Field</p>

<p>The record is inputted into the field, but you have also revealed an
additional field titled ‘Member.’ As mentioned a little earlier, a
variable member refers to its component variables. The ‘.’ separating
the record and the member field is a special operator type known as the
Referencing Operator. By the referencing operator, the internal members
of the record instance have been made available. Clicking the ‘Member’
field now will present you with the following view.</p>

<p><img src="./040_Records/image8.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Referencing Record Member</p>

<p>Here, the Starting Minerals member can be selected, do so and click
‘Ok.’ The result will look as follows.</p>

<p><img src="./040_Records/image9.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Referenced Record Variable</p>

<p>Setting the member variable here has finished the referencing procedure.
Now, the Starting Minerals value will be set to the ‘Value’ field, via
the reference to its record instance Player Data. When this action runs,
it will be passed to the record instance, then follow this reference to
the internal structure where the variable is. It will then carry the
variable value out and use it.</p>

<h2 id="record-arrays">RECORD ARRAYS</h2>

<p>Record instances also have support for arrays. On highlighting a record
in the subview, select ‘Array.’ This will allow you to set ‘Dimension’
and ‘Size’ elements like any typical array. Each member of the array
will have the standard record design, with all its members set to the
standard initial values. This is useful for handling large swathes of
data in a very organized package. A typical record array is shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./040_Records/image10.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Record Array</p>

<p>Referencing variables from within a record array is generally the same
as referencing a standard record variable. The difference is that an
index is required to select the specific instance you want. A typical
view is shown below.</p>
