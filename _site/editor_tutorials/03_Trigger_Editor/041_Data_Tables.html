<h1 id="data-tables">DATA TABLES</h1>

<p>As a project develops and scales, you’ll soon find that it demands data
organization beyond the use of simple variables, and beyond tools like
folders, labels, and trigger libraries. For organizing large volumes of
data, the Editor offers a pair of higher level data structures.</p>

<p>One such structure is the Array. This element is explained in more
detail elsewhere in the manual, but as a refresher it’s worth noting
that any variable in the Editor may be transformed into an array. This
will expand the variable beyond a single value into an array sized for
any number of variables of a certain type, provided the size and type
are defined in the Trigger Editor prior to play.</p>

<p>Arrays have great utility, they are strongly typed and readily accessed.
They are a mainstay of creating things with the Editor. Still, their
construction is rigid. They can be made quickly, but must be well
designed, since you can’t change their structure during game time. For
scenarios that require something more flexible, you can use the other
higher level data structure, the Data Table.</p>

<p>As their name implies, data tables order data into a table stored in the
backend of a map. While you can’t physically see this table, it takes
the following abstract form.</p>

<hr />
<p>Name     Value
  ——– ———
  Name     Value</p>

<p>Name     Value</p>

<p>Name     Value</p>

<p>…      …
  ——————</p>

<p>As shown above, a data table hosts data that has been entered into the
table as a name-value pair. The Name classifies the data under a unique
string that is set when the data is written to the table. This string
serves as a handle for finding the data again, whether retrieving it for
use or removing it from the table. The Value is the value of the table
entry, just the same as a single variable has a value or an array
component has a value. In addition to this, each entry has its own
implicit Type; the type of data is set based on which trigger action is
used to write the data to the table.</p>

<h2 id="data-table-properties">DATA TABLE PROPERTIES</h2>

<p>In contrast to arrays, the structure of data tables is not rigidly
defined before game time. They may grow or shrink in size, having
entries appended or removed during gameplay. Moreover, the data table
itself has no type, it can contain any mixture of data types, the
composition of which can be in constant flux.</p>

<p>Data tables possess these properties because they do not consume a
fixed, constant amount of memory, instead using something called Dynamic
Memory Allocation. Under dynamic memory allocation, memory is declared
and used by the table, then released when it is no longer needed.
Fortunately, using the Editor means you don’t really need to know the
specifics of memory use. All you need to take away from this is that
data tables are dynamic, while arrays are static.</p>

<p>Another difference between data tables and arrays is the impact they
have on performance. Since these structures operate as containers, you
may already have realized that locating their contents will take the
engine some amount of time. Not only is this correct, but it is a
definable property. Every time a value from one these structures is
used, there is a Search Time that describes how long it takes the Editor
to find something in one of these containers as a product of how many
things are in the container. Arrays have Linear Search Time. Every
component added will linearly increase the search time. Making an array
10 times bigger, will increase the search time by 10 times too. By
virtue of their name-value pairing, Data tables have Constant Search
Time. Strange as it may sound, making a data table 10 times bigger will
not affect its search time.</p>

<p>If this topic feels like an unwelcome glimpse into the back-end of the
Editor, take heart. The important thing here is that you learn that data
tables perform much better for ‘large’ collections of data. The exact
definition of ‘large’ here depends on the specific project at hand, and
for most ‘small’ amounts of data both structures will provide adequate
results. As a rule of thumb for those with little experience, it is best
to consider the other advantageous properties of a data structure well
in advance of performance considerations. If you start seeing
performance slippage in a game, adapting ‘large’ arrays into data tables
is a clear way to seek improvements.</p>

<p>As a last note, there is one drawback to dynamic memory allocation in
the possibility of a Memory Leak. This occurs when memory is being
allocated, but not being freed after use. Just as a leak in a boat will
cause it to slowly take on water, a leaking data table will result in a
project consuming more and more memory over time. This will cause the
game to start to sink, slowing down or even crashing once no more memory
resources are left to use. Keep in mind that data tables give more
control during game time than arrays, but in more complex projects they
can require some tidying up.</p>

<h2 id="data-table-actions">DATA TABLE ACTIONS</h2>

<p>Data tables are constructed, used, and destroyed using of a set of
trigger actions. These actions can be found during action creation by
navigating to the ‘Data Table’ label, as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./041_Data_Tables/image1.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Data Table Actions</p>

<p>Despite the length of this list, there are only three major actions. The
length is due to one of the actions being made available in many
versions. The actions are broken down in the table below.</p>

<hr />
<p>Action   Effect
  ——– —————————————————————–
  Clear    Clears a data table, removing all of its entries. The data table
  Data     is selected by specifying the Scope it is found in.
  Table</p>

<p>Remove   Removes a specific entry from a data table. The entry is selected
  Data     by using its Name, and the Scope of the data table it is stored
  Table    in.
  Value</p>

<p>Save     Adds an entry to a data table. The entry is written to the table
  Data     by specifying its Name and Value pair, then selecting the Scope
  Table    of the data table being written to. Almost every Editor data type
  Value    has its own version of this action; there are 46 versions in
           total. Depending on the selected version, the data’s Type is
           implicitly set within the table.
  ————————————————————————–</p>

<h2 id="data-table-scope">DATA TABLE SCOPE</h2>

<p>Every data table exists at a certain scope, either Global or Local.
These scopes are used to target specific data tables for reading or
writing data. Below is an example action, which writes the Point ‘Unit
Spawn’ to the Global data table.</p>

<p><img src="./041_Data_Tables/image2.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Writing Data to the Global Data Table</p>

<p>The Global data table has universal access, is singular, and always
exists within a project. By contrast, Local data tables have their
access tied to a single trigger. A Local data table is created once data
is first written within a trigger using a Save Data Table Value action.
The table will then receive any further data that is written at its
scope until it is cleared. Similarly to Local variables, Local data
tables are also cleared when their hosting trigger has concluded.</p>

<p>As a result of data table scope, there are pseudo-limits on a user’s
ability to create and target data tables. At any location within a
project’s logic, only the Global table or the current trigger’s Local
table may be used directly. Values can be passed between triggers to
access other Local scopes, which may be a key consideration in the
program’s design.</p>

<p>The major advantage of scope is in insulating a project from memory
leaks. Since Local scopes are eliminated after a trigger finishes, there
is an automatic failsafe for removing or clearing data in Local data
tables. The corollary to this, is that the Global data table is the main
culprit for memory leaks, and you should watch it carefully if it’s
being used frequently in a project.</p>

<p>| 
| VALUE FROM DATA TABLE FUNCTIONS
  -------------------------------</p>

<p>Data is retrieved from data tables using a set of versioned Value From
Data Table functions. You can access these during any field-filling by
navigating to the ‘Function’ source and sorting by the ‘Data Table’
label, as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./041_Data_Tables/image3.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Value From Data Table Function for Points Data</p>

<p>The above example shows the Value From Data Table function available for
Points. This function is demonstrated in the following example.</p>

<p><img src="./041_Data_Tables/image4.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Reading Points Data from the Global Data Table</p>

<p>Here, a Point has been retrieved from the Global data table, using its
Name ‘Unit Spawn.’ It has then been set to a variable for further use.</p>
