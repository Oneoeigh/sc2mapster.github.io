<h1 id="action-definitions">ACTION DEFINITIONS</h1>

<p>Action Definitions allow you to create customized sequences of action
statements. Once assembled, they can be used in the same context that
their component actions would be. They also give support for parameters,
input values that can alter the behavior of the definition. By
organizing actions into larger hierarchical chunks, you can use action
definitions to take procedures that repeat often and abstract them into
a robust tool to be deployed as needed. Properly used, this will save
you time, make your code easier to understand, and even optimize
performance.</p>

<h2 id="demoing-an-action-definition">DEMOING AN ACTION DEFINITION</h2>

<p>Open the demo map provided with this article and navigate to the Trigger
Editor. This project contains a single trigger that runs on map
initialization, populating the map with three distinct sets of a tree
and a patch of grass, and using some actor modifications on the models
as they are generated.</p>

<p>Tree and Grass Generation Actions</p>

<p>The overall operation is fairly simple, but it consists of three similar
procedures differentiated only by where they are creating objects.
Redundant, bloated triggering should stand out as a possible location
for an action statement. In this case, the repeated model creation
options and their various actor messages could all be moved into an
action definition.</p>

<p>To create an action definition, right-click on the Triggers Panel and
navigate to New -&gt; New Action Definition. Name the definition ‘Create
Tree.’ Now, hold shift and select the first five actions of the main
trigger. Copy these actions into the new action definition, so that
you’re left with the following view.</p>

height=”2.19792in”}</p>

<p>Create Tree Action Definition</p>

<p>You have now refactored the redundant actions into a custom action
definition. At this point, you can change the ‘Create Trees’ trigger to
use the action definition three times, rather than its current bloat of
code. Add the action definition to a trigger by accessing it from its
‘call’ location, the action list. Right-click on the trigger and select
New Action, then find the ‘Create Tree’ definition, as shown below.</p>

<p>Using the New Action Definition</p>

<p>Repeat this action three times to reflect the three operations it is
replacing and clear out all the unnecessary code. This should leave you
with the following.</p>

<p>Reorganized Main Trigger</p>

<h2 id="action-definition-parameters">ACTION DEFINITION PARAMETERS</h2>

<p>Despite the main trigger being significantly cleaned up, something has
been overlooked. Remember that each tree and grass grouping were being
spawned at differing locations. As it stands now, the definition spawns
a tree and grass patch at only one location, Point (20, 20).</p>

<p>You can make your action definition have variable results using
parameters. A parameter value can pass additional information to the
action definition. Creation of objects in three differing locations will
require you to use a varying Point parameter. You can arrange this by
moving to the ‘Create Tree’ action definition, then right-clicking on
the ‘Parameters’ heading and navigating to New -&gt; New Parameter. Name
the parameter ‘Location’ and set its type to Point. Select each action
using the Point(20,20) as a location field, and alter it to the
‘Location’ variable. You should be presented with the following.</p>

<p>Action Definition with Parameter</p>

<p>Now return to the main trigger. Here you’ll see each action requiring an
input parameter for ‘Location.’ Alter the values for each action to
match the original locations at which the trees were spawned. This will
give you a functional final trigger, shown below.</p>
