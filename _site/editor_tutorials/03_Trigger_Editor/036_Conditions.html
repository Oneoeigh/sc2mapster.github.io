<h1 id="conditions">CONDITIONS</h1>

<p>Conditions are used within triggers to determine whether ‘something
about the game’ is true or false. The ambiguity here is intentional, as
conditions can be applied to almost any object and any occurrence in the
game.</p>

<p>Essentially, conditions pose questions about the game. One example could
be, ‘Does this player have at least five units?’ The game then responds
with its knowledge of that property, the player’s unit count, and
answers – true or false. Based on the answer, statements in the Editor
can proceed in different ways, a notion typically called ‘Control.’</p>

<p>Control allows you to break the Editor’s basic linear behavior. With
conditions, elements like a trigger can become non-linear, avoiding
certain segments of code, repeating certain segments multiple times, or
completely stopping and jumping to entirely different locations
altogether. Conditions allow for choices, and this is an important
aspect of creating things that are dynamic, lively, and interesting.</p>

<p>The idea of conditions as questions is something you should try to keep
in mind. This is a helpful habit that can be useful in figuring out if a
condition is appropriate for a given scenario. It will also help when
you start learning the mathematical notation that the StarCraft Editor
expresses conditions in.</p>

<h2 id="preparing-a-trigger">PREPARING A TRIGGER</h2>

<p>To demonstrate the use of conditions you’ll need to assemble a trigger.
Use the following procedure to prepare the base trigger.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a new custom map and navigate to the Trigger Editor.</li>
  <li>Proceed to the “Melee Initialization” trigger and delete all of the
default actions and events contained within it.</li>
  <li>Create a new event by navigating to Events -&gt; Key Pressed.</li>
  <li>Set the ‘Key’ term of the event to the key ‘1.’</li>
  <li>Create a new variable via Local Variables -&gt; New Element.</li>
  <li>Name the local variable ‘Press Count’ and set its type to ‘Integer.’</li>
  <li>Create a new action by navigating to Actions -&gt; Modify Variable
(Integer).</li>
  <li>Set the ‘Variable’ term of the action to the variable ‘Press Count.’</li>
  <li>Set the ‘Value’ term of the action to ‘1.’</li>
</ul>

<p>This should leave you with the following.</p>

<p>Trigger Basis</p>

<h2 id="control-statements">CONTROL STATEMENTS</h2>

<p>Conditions aren’t relegated solely to the ‘Conditions’ heading in a
trigger, they also appear in a type of action called Control Statements.
One such action is ‘If Then Else.’ This action allows you to specify a
condition that, depending on the result of a true or false question,
will proceed to one of two possible blocks of statements, one for true
and one for false. That block of statements is then run a single time,
while the other block is skipped. The condition is specified under the
‘If’ heading of the control statement, while the block of statements for
a true response is under a ‘Then’ heading, and the block of statements
for a false response is under an ‘Else’ heading.</p>

<p>As such, the ‘If Then Else’ control statement can be considered as
question and response in the form, ‘If this happens Then do this, Else
do this.’</p>

<p>You can investigate the ‘If Then Else’ control statement by adding it to
your trigger below the ‘Modify Press Count + 1’ statement via New -&gt;
New Action -&gt; If Then Else. You’ll find the control statements under
the ‘ – General’ category in the ‘Actions’ window.</p>

<p>Selecting If Then Else Action</p>

<h2 id="condition-operators">CONDITION OPERATORS</h2>

<p>Add a condition to the ‘If Then Else’ action by right-clicking on the
‘If’ heading and navigating to New -&gt; New Condition. This will launch
the ‘Configure Condition’ window shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./036_Conditions/image3.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Operators View</p>

<p>Configuring a condition requires two things, assembling the terms of the
condition and selecting what are known as the Operators. In the question
model, the former involves what the condition is inquiring about, while
the latter forms the type of question that a condition will ask. Each
operator has their own specific function when it comes to forming
conditions, which are described in the below table.</p>

<hr />
<p>Oper   Details

  And    Creates a union between two terms. Both terms are then tested
         together.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     If both terms test true, then the result is true. If both terms
     test false, then the result is false. If one terms tests true
     but the other does not, then the result is false.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Comp   Evaluates and compares two terms. This is actually a group of
  aris   operators, listed in the next six entries.
  on</p>

<p>!=     If the terms are not equal, return true. If equal, return false.</p>

<p>&lt;     If the leftmost term is smaller than the rightmost term, return
         true. If not, return false. Equal terms return false.</p>

<p>&lt;=    If the leftmost term is smaller than the rightmost term, return
         true. If not, return false. Equal terms return false.</p>

<p>==     If the terms are equal, return true. If not, return false.</p>

<p>&gt;     If the leftmost term is larger than the rightmost term, return
         true. If not, return false. Equal terms return false.</p>

<p>&gt;=    If the leftmost term is larger than the rightmost term, return
         true. If not, return false. Equal terms return true.</p>

<p>Not    Inverts the term. Testing the Not version of a term will provide
         a result that is the opposite the normal term’s result.</p>

<p>Or     Creates a union between two terms. Both terms are then tested
         together.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     Differs from And in that if a single term tests true, then the
     result is true. If both terms test true, then the result is
     true. If both test false, then the result is false.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With   A composite operator that tests if a term is between two values.
  in     This will also return true if the Value is equal to either term,
  Boun   as it uses two &lt;= operators, in the form Min Value &lt;= Term &lt;=
  ds     Max Value. This operator supports only the Integer, Byte, and
         Real value types.
  ———————————————————————–</p>

<h2 id="configuring-your-condition">CONFIGURING YOUR CONDITION</h2>

<p>Finish setting your condition by navigating to the ‘Comparison’ within
the ‘Configure Condition’ window. Set the terms by clicking on the
headings within the subview. ‘Value 1’ corresponds to the first term,
while ‘Value 2’ corresponds to the second term, which follows the
operator. Set the first term to the variable ‘Press Count’ by double
clicking on ‘Value 1’ and navigating to Variable -&gt; Press Count. Set
the second term by double clicking on ‘Value 2’, navigating to Value,
and inputting 10. Now set the operator by double clicking on ‘Operator’
and navigating to ==.</p>

<p><img src="./036_Conditions/image4.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Setting the Term</p>

<p>Click ‘Ok’ to return to the Trigger Editor. Now you can finish the
trigger with the following procedure.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Under the ‘Then’ heading, create a ‘Text Message’ action. Set the
Message to ‘High Reset.’</li>
  <li>Also here, create a ‘Set Variable’ action. Set the variable to Press
Count and the value to ‘0.’</li>
  <li>Under the ‘Else’ heading, create a ‘Text Message’ action. Set the
Message to ‘Low.’</li>
</ul>

<p>You should now be left with something that looks like the image below.</p>

<p><img src="./036_Conditions/image5.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Completed Trigger</p>

<p>You have assembled a trigger that triggers every time the player presses
the 1 key on the keyboard. This increments the variable each time. Then,
depending on the condition Press Count == 10, one of two block
statements will be run. A true statement results in the message ‘High
Reset,’ a false statement results in the message ‘Low.’ As such, each
trigger poses the question, ‘Is the variable equal to 10?’ It then
determines which procedure to follow based on the condition’s response.</p>

<p>In practice, this should be false for the first nine triggers, then true
for the tenth. The ‘High Reset’ message will show on the tenth keypress.
You can test the map to confirm that it’s working correctly by
navigating to File -&gt; Test Document. If you’ve done everything right,
you should get the result shown below.</p>
