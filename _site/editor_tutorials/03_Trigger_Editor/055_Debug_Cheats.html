<h1 id="debug-cheats">DEBUG CHEATS</h1>

<p>Cheat codes were originally intended as testing elements for developers.
When games began to be ship with these codes still included, they became
a favorite for players to experiment with and use as shortcuts past
irksome obstacles. Although player-side cheats like GreedIsGood and
Black Sheep Wall still exist in StarCraft II, there are many more cheats
that you can enable to ease development and testing of your projects.
Below you’ll find a list of these debug cheats for easy reference.</p>

<h2 id="test-document-cheats">TEST DOCUMENT CHEATS</h2>

<p>When testing a document from the editor, the Test Document Cheats are
available. These are special chat commands that allow for game-time
actions like creating units and modifying resources. They save
developers from having to hand design special triggers for commonly
performed testing tasks. These cheats are broken down in the table
below.</p>

<p>An example trial of some of these test document cheats is shown below.</p>

<p>Test Document Cheats</p>

<p>It should be noted that there is no way to enable these cheats for
multiplayer tests. Should you require something similar, you’ll need to
devise a custom solution. If some mixture between private and public
testing is desired, it is recommended to limit access to cheats to
yourself as the developer and trusted parties only. This can be done
with secrecy, but a better method is to use player handles and make a
check of them upon either entering the game or within the conditions of
each cheat trigger. Doing so will ensure that only a hardcoded list of
players has access to your equivalent of test document cheats in
multiplayer trials. You can see one example a system like this below.</p>

<p>Multiplayer Test Document Cheats</p>

<h2 id="actor-cheats">ACTOR CHEATS</h2>

<p>When testing a document from the editor, Actor Cheats are also
available. These cheats provide a number of ways to create and control
Actors without needing to create custom testing provisions. It should be
noted that</p>

<p>actor cheats are the only way to debug actors, as the Trigger Debugger
does not contain any information about them due to their asynchronous
nature. Actor cheats are similar to test document cheats in that they
are activated by entering text into the in-game chat.</p>

<p>A particularly useful actor cheat command is actorinfodisplay. This
command will display an in-game overlay showing how many actors and
actor scopes are currently active, along with other useful information.
The following images show the actor stats before and after a stress test
trial.</p>
