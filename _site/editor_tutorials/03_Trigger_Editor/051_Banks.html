<h1 id="banks">BANKS</h1>

<p>Banks are the Editor’s method for storing information and using it
between projects. Below you can see a sample bank file.</p>

<p><img src="./051_Banks/image1.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Custom Game Bank File</p>

<p>This bank stores a player’s personal statistics from a type of custom
game. Note the structure here. A bank is separated hierarchically first
by sections and then into key-value pairings. As values are stored in
the bank, they are written to the bank file in a target section, and by
their associated key, but in no particular order beyond that.</p>

<h2 id="bank-actions">BANK ACTIONS</h2>

<p>The controls for bank handling can be found during action creation under
the label ‘Bank.’ This is shown below, followed by a table that breaks
down these controls.</p>

<p>Bank Actions</p>

<hr />
<p>Action    Effect
  ——— —————————————————————-
  Preload   Preloads and synchronizes a Bank for a specific Player.
  Bank</p>

<p>Create    Creates a bank Section, which can then accept key-value pairs.
  Bank    <br />
  Section</p>

<p>Save Bank Saves a Bank, making sure that all changes to the file are
            maintained after the game.</p>

<p>Store     Stores a Value as a Key to a certain Section of a Bank. There
  Data      are several types available for storage: Boolean, Integer, Real,
            Point, String, Text, and Unit.</p>

<p>Reload    Reloads a Bank, reverting any changes that might have occurred
  Bank      between saves.</p>

<p>Open Bank Opens a Bank for use and alteration.</p>

<p>Restore   Creates a unit that was previously stored through a Store Unit
  Unit      action. The unit is restored from a Key within a Section from a
            Bank. This results in the unit being created at a Point, for a
            Player, and facing an Angle.</p>

<p>Wait For  This is a Wait control statement that pauses until the condition
  Bank      of a specific Bank being reloaded is True.</p>

<p>Set Bank  Sets the Signature option of a Bank to Enable or Disable. The
  Option    signature provides an encryption option for banks, so that they
            cannot be altered by players.</p>

<p>Remove    Removes a Key from the Section of a Bank and its associate
  Bank Key  value.</p>

<p>Remove    Removes a Section from a Bank and all of the key-value pairs it
  Bank      contains.

<p>You can find the local bank storage at the Windows location described
below.</p>
