<h1 id="ui-events">UI EVENTS</h1>

<p>The exact mechanics of how StarCraft reacts to a player’s input can
sometimes feel opaque and inaccessible. Despite the great deal of
control offered by the Editor, there is still a host of unknown factors
arising from a mixture of hardware, operating system, and back-end
engine considerations. To combat this sealed-off feeling, there are a
number of ways of getting between a player’s input to their computer and
the game’s reactions. For triggering, the focus is a selection of events
that respond to player inputs, collectively known as the UI Events. You
can see these during event creation by sorting according to the ‘UI’
label, as shown below.</p>

<p>UI Events Listing</p>

<p>The following table provides a breakdown of these events.</p>

<hr />
<p>Event       Details
  ———– ——————————————————————-
  Abort       Triggers when a Player clicks the ‘Abort Mission’ button from the
  Mission     game menu.</p>

<p>Button      Triggers when a Player clicks a Button from the command card. That
  Pressed     button can be identified with the Button Pressed function. This is
              a performance intensive event.</p>

<p>Custom      Triggers when a Player closes a dialog with a certain Result,
  Dialog      either Yes, No, or Any. The Result can be identified with the
  Dismissed   function Custom Dialog Result, and the Player with the function
              Triggering Player.</p>

<p>Game        Triggers when the end game credits finish rolling for a Player.
  Credits   <br />
  Finished</p>

<p>Game Menu   Triggers when a Player selects a Game Menu Item. Examples include
  Item        Save Button, Quit Button, Abort Mission, or Achievements Button.
  Selected    Available identifiers here are the Game Menu Selected and the
              Triggering Player functions.</p>

<p>Hotkey      Triggers when a Player presses a Hotkey into a certain state,
  Pressed     either Down or Up. The hotkeys are a variety of utility controls
              that are each bound to a single key, examples include Army Select,
              Idle Worker, and Warp-in. Available identifiers are the Hotkey
              Pressed function for the Hotkey, and the Triggering Player function
              for the Player. Note that, if code that handles the hotkey press
              has already been written, then the hotkey will no longer trigger
              this event. This is a performance intensive event.</p>

<p>Key Pressed Triggers when a Player presses a Key into a certain state, either
              Down or Up, with any of several modifiers activated: Shift,
              Control, and Alt. Each key press can be identified with the
              functions Key Pressed, Shift Key Pressed, Control Key Pressed, and
              Alt Key Pressed. This is a performance intensive event.</p>

<p>Mouse       Triggers when a Player presses a Mouse Button into a certain state,
  Clicked     either Down or Up. Available mouse buttons include Left, Right, and
              Middle. The click itself can be identified with the function Mouse
              Clicked Button, then the functions Mouse Clicked UI Pos X or Y, and
              Mouse Clicked World Pos X, Y, and Z can identify coordinates in the
              screen space or game space respectively. This is a performance
              intensive event.</p>

<p>Mouse Moved Triggers when a Player moves their mouse. The functions Mouse
              Clicked UI Pos X or Y, and Mouse Clicked World Pos X, Y, and Z can
              identify coordinates in the screen space or game space
              respectively. This is a performance intensive event.</p>

<p>Mouse Wheel Triggers when a Player moves their mouse wheel. The function Mouse
              Wheel Moved provides a magnitude of the movement. This is a
              performance intensive event.</p>

<p>Resources   Triggers when a Player requests resources using the team resources
  Requested   menu.</p>

<p>Resources   Triggers when a Player trades resources to a Recipient Player using
  Traded      the team resources menu.</p>

<p>Target Mode Triggers when a Player turns the targeting mode of an Ability
  Updated     Command to a certain State, either On, Off, or Any.
  ——————————————————————————-</p>

<h2 id="performance-concerns">PERFORMANCE CONCERNS</h2>

<p>Monitoring player inputs can cause certain UI events to trigger an
extremely large number of times. This is mostly a concern with the
Button Pressed, Hotkey Pressed, Key Pressed, Mouse Clicked, Mouse Moved,
and Mouse Wheel events. As a result, you should be careful to use these
events only as necessary. Should you need to use these events, one
technique for avoiding performance dragging is to pair the monitoring
trigger with a condition that will close off the event until it is
needed again. An example of this is shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./049_UI_Events/image2.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Input Event Throttle</p>

<h2 id="examining-ui-events">EXAMINING UI EVENTS</h2>

<p>Each UI event responds to a certain player input, then usually offers
some identifier functions to help describe the input for use. This is
particularly true for mouse events, a subset of UI events that offers a
large variety of identifying functions to describe the number of mouse
movements and mouse button presses available to a player. You can see
these events from the event creation screen by searching for ‘Mouse,’ as
shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./049_UI_Events/image3.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Mouse UI Events</p>

<p>In the demo map provided with this tutorial, you’ll find some sample
triggers showing how UI events are generally used. Opening the map and
navigating to the Trigger Editor will give you the following view.</p>

<p><img src="./049_UI_Events/image4.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Map Trigger Editor View</p>

<p>The map contains a single marine, which has been identified and set to a
variable on initialization. The rest of the triggers will use player
inputs to create a control scheme that directly grafts control of the
marine to the mouse. Of course, this is a pronounced change from
StarCraft’s traditional RTS control setup, which allows for the
selection and control of a lot of units. To support this control scheme,
mouse drag selection or ‘box-selecting’ has been disabled here. If you
check the ‘mouseMove,’ ‘mouseDown,’ and ‘mouseUP’ triggers, you’ll find
the following.</p>

<p><img src="./049_UI_Events/image5.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Mouse UI Triggers</p>

<p>A system for direct control of a unit has been built using a combination
of two Mouse Clicked events, ‘mouseDOWN’ and ‘mouseUP,’ and a Mouse
Moved event, ‘mouseMove.’ This works by constantly monitoring the
mouse’s position with the ‘mouseMove’ trigger, and archiving that
position using two identifying functions Mouse Moved World Pos X, and
Mouse Moved World Pos Y. When a player clicks the mouse, the ‘mouseDown’
event fires, entering into a While loop that creates a constant move
order for that unit to the last archived position of the mouse.</p>

<p>This process continues as long as the player holds the mouse button
down, resulting in continuous movement of the unit in response to those
two triggers working together. When the mouse button is unclicked, or
‘clicked up,’ the While loop in ‘mouseDown’ is broken and movement
stops. Testing the map should present you something like the image
below.</p>

<p><img src="./049_UI_Events/image6.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Direct Marine Control</p>

<p>This demonstrates one reason that you might want to get between player
inputs and making use of UI events. Here it has been used to give
players a new way of controlling the game, which can be a lot of fun.
Still, there a lot of events required to keep the movement smooth. If
you open the Trigger Debugger, you’ll gain some insight into this
process.</p>

<p><img src="./049_UI_Events/image7.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Direct Marine Control</p>

<p>Here, you can see that the constant mouse monitoring has resulted in
250+ events firing in the course of just a few seconds. This should give
you an impression of how operations like this can get very expensive in
terms of performance.</p>
