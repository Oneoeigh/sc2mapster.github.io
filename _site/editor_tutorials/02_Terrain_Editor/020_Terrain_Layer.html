<h1 id="terrain-layer">TERRAIN LAYER</h1>

<p>The Terrain Layer deals with the fundamental elements of terrain design,
including ground texture, elevation, cliffs, and water. You can access
it from the Terrain Bar, by clicking the icon shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./020_Terrain_Layer/image1.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Terrain Layer Icon</p>

<h2 id="terrain-palette">TERRAIN PALETTE</h2>

<p>Every map begins at the creation screen, here you’ll make basic
decisions about the look of your map, determining its texture, height,
and size. Once the Editor has generated the map, it will open in the
Terrain Editor, giving you a fresh slate of terrain, a blank canvas.</p>

<p><img src="./020_Terrain_Layer/image2.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Map Creation</p>

<p>The terrain development process usually begins at the Terrain Layer.
Continuing the painting theme, the tools in this layer are called
brushes. They can be found in the Terrain Palette, shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./020_Terrain_Layer/image3.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Terrain Palette</p>

<h2 id="brush-options">BRUSH OPTIONS</h2>

<p>Selecting any brush will display various modifiers within the palette.
Every brush has options allowing you to control the ways in which you
‘paint’ your terrain. Below you’ll see an example of these options,
followed by a breakdown of all the options available to you.</p>

<p><img src="./020_Terrain_Layer/image4.png" alt="Image" /></p>

  le    various opacity, shape, and randomness options.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    The Paintbrush style is the default standard with no additional
    effects.

    The Airbrush style applies a degree of opacity around the edges
    of the application area, controlled by the Variability slider.

    The Noise style adds a random component to the application, while
    the Fractal style applies the brush recursively. These final two
    styles, and their modification with the properties Variability
    and Resolution, are best described by the preview found in the
    Editor.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Beyond these general options, each of the nine brushes available in the
Terrain Layer has a number of unique options. You can read a breakdown
of the brushes and their options in the following sections.</p>

<h2 id="the-brushes">THE BRUSHES</h2>

<p><img src="./020_Terrain_Layer/image5.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>This tool allows you to paint textures onto the surface of the map.

<p><img src="./020_Terrain_Layer/image15.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>This tool renders roads, which are treated as a special type of visual
element. Roads are rendered automatically along a path laid down by this
tool in points. This system is designed to quickly generate realistic
looking roads without having to lay down individual doodad segments.</p>

<p><img src="./020_Terrain_Layer/image19.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>This tool gives you access to a palette of four lighting regions to
paint onto your map. It also allows you to mix these regions together.
When the game is launched, each individual region will have a
corresponding set of lighting options applied within its bounds. Any
areas with a mix of lighting regions will have the lighting options
mixed as well. This allows you to build dynamic, realistic lighting
environments. While the brush is active, the four lighting regions are
displayed using colored overlays of red, green, blue, and yellow.</p>

<p><img src="./020_Terrain_Layer/image20.png" alt="Image" /></p>
