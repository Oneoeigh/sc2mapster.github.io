<h1 id="texture-sets">TEXTURE SETS</h1>

<p>The type of textures available for use on any given map's terrain are
organized into sets. Historically these sets are known as tilesets,
owing to the 2D roots of the RTS genre. Now though, they are referred to
within the StarCraft II Editor as Texture Sets, referring to the fact
that they are composed of individual Texture assets. This name game
actually extends further, and the data type of texture sets are referred
to in the Data Editor as Terrain Types. The names of the prebuilt sets
are likely familiar to anyone who has experience with the campaign or
competitive StarCraft. Examples include: Bel'Shir, Shakuras, and Char.
An example of one such set, as presented in the Terrain Palette, is
shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./030_Texture_Sets/image1.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Bel’Shir Texture Set</p>

<p>The composition of Texture Sets/Types is limited for performance
reasons. The robust landscape painting provided in the Terrain Editor
allows a lot of blending in between its texture palette. As a result,
the scope of textures available at any given time must be limited.
Fortunately, existing palettes can be configured and entirely new ones
can be custom-built to open up more diverse texture options for a
particular project.</p>

<h2 id="terrain-textures">TERRAIN TEXTURES</h2>

<p>Terrain types are composed of a set of eight individual textures, which
are stored in data as Terrain Textures. This type is built from raw
texture files that then have several fields injected into them. Doing so
gives the texture the proper information in terms of things like
physics, lighting, and foliage typing, rendering it eligible for use in
the game. Some important fields of the Terrain Texture type can be found
in the following table.</p>

<hr />
<p>Property   Details
  ———- —————————————————————–
  Physics    The material reported to the actor system for certain events
  Material   occurring on this texture's space. For example, in the Trigger
             Editor actors can be made to play different sounds or use
             alternate models, depending on the texture's physics material.</p>

<p>Doodads    Determines what type of foliage is generated on this terrain via
             the Generate Foliage function of the Terrain Palette.</p>

<p>Texture    Sets the visible texture for the Terrain Texture. It provides the
             look of a specific texture, but will not always reflect its exact
             in-game appearance through the Editor if a normal map is
             required.</p>

<p>Normal Map Sets the normal map, which controls reflected color and game
             lighting data. Omission of a normal map will likely result in
             graphical errors.
  —————————————————————————-</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-custom-terrain-texture">CREATING A CUSTOM TERRAIN TEXTURE</h2>

<p>First, create a new Arcade map and set its default texture set to
'Bel'Shir (Jungle).' You don’t need to specify any other map
properties for this tutorial. Now move to the Data Editor by navigating
to Modules -&gt; Data.</p>

<p>Within Data, open the terrain textures tab and create a terrain texture
by right-clicking the Object Listing and selecting ‘Add Terrain
Texture.’ This should appear as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./030_Texture_Sets/image2.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Creating Terrain Texture</p>

<p>This will launch a 'Terrain Texture Properties' window. Enter ‘Demo
Texture’ under ‘Name,’ then hit the ‘Suggest’ button to generate an ID.
The completed terrain texture creation screen should look like this.</p>

<p><img src="./030_Texture_Sets/image3.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Creating Terrain Texture</p>

<p>Click ‘Ok’ to create your terrain texture, then move on to the newly
created texture’s fields. You should now select a raw texture by double
clicking the ‘Texture’ field, as in the image below.</p>

<p><img src="./030_Texture_Sets/image4.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Creating Terrain Texture</p>

<p>Opening the ‘Texture’ field will launch an ‘Object Values’ window with a
browse option. Clicking the ‘Browse’ button should bring you to the
Archive Browser, where you can select a texture. Quickly select the
lavasilvertoprock.dds texture using the search function, then hit ‘Ok’
to complete selection.</p>

<p><img src="./030_Texture_Sets/image5.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Selecting Terrain Texture</p>

<p>You will also have to supply a normal map texture alongside the base
texture. Double click the cell to the right of the 'Normal Map' field
and repeat the same process as used for the 'Texture' field. This
time, find the texturelavasilvertoprock_nrm.dds and click 'OK' to
select it for use.</p>

<p><img src="./030_Texture_Sets/image6.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Selecting Terrain Texture Normal Map</p>

<p>Note that the suffix _nrm in the texture name identifies this as the
associated normal map for your texture. However, it’s worth noting that
some normal maps in the editor use the endings _normal or _norm. If
the Editor can’t find an associated normal map for your texture, you
should select the same texture file for the 'Normal Map' field as you
have already used for the 'Texture' field. If you don’t supply any
normal map at all, you may encounter graphical issues due to the engine
lacking certain lighting and color information for your map.</p>

<h2 id="setting-custom-foliage">SETTING CUSTOM FOLIAGE</h2>

<p>By using the 'Generate Foliage' function in the Terrain Editor, you
can populate each terrain texture in the ‘Allow Foliage’ area with its
associated type of foliage drawn from the ‘Doodads’ field. Adding this
functionality to the texture under construction should prove
educational. To add support for foliage on your new texture, double
click the cell to the right of the 'Doodads - ' heading.</p>

<p><img src="./030_Texture_Sets/image7.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Foliage Doodad Input</p>

<p>From the 'Object Values' window that you’ve just launched, click the
green + button to add a new foliage doodad to the terrain texture. Doing
so will add a new blank doodad. You can define it by selecting the
‘Choose’ button. Clicking this button will launch a popup that allows
you to select any Model type from the project’s data. This process is
shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./030_Texture_Sets/image8.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Foliage Doodad Selection</p>

<p>Select the ‘Shakuras Tree’ Model and click ‘Ok.’ At this point, foliage
generation will support this terrain texture. Anytime the texture is
within an ‘Allow Foliage’ zone, activating the Generate Foliage function
in the Terrain Editor will create the doodad in an amount based on the
Density (Per Cell) settings in the Terrain Palette.</p>

<p>Foliage tends to look best when it is created with some randomness. This
mimics a natural environment. There are a few options in this menu to
help with this. One option here is the checkbox titled 'Random
Rotation.' If you activate this, it will rotate each doodad model to
face a random direction on generation. Check the 'Random Rotation' box
to enable it and click 'OK' to finish.</p>

<p><img src="./030_Texture_Sets/image9.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Completed Doodads Input</p>

<p>Another option not addressed in this article is to populate this doodad
list with multiple types of possible foliage to ensure a distribution of
different models. You can then set the Probability of each doodad, which
will change the proportion in which they are generated. For now though,
stick to the single model already selected.</p>

<h2 id="altering-a-texture-set">ALTERING A TEXTURE SET</h2>

<p>Now that you have your Terrain Texture prepared, you’ll need to add it
to the texture set being used by the map itself. Remember that you've
selected the 'Bel'Shir (Jungle)' set for this map. As mentioned
earlier, these sets are collected internally within the Data Editor
under the datatype Terrain Types. You could construct a completely new
terrain type, but for the moment you can just alter the current map set
to substitute the ‘Demo Texture’ for one of its eight default textures.</p>

<p>Open the terrain textures tab by navigating to + -&gt; Edit Terrain Data
-&gt; Terrain Types, then find the pre-existing type 'Bel'Shir
(jungle)' in the Object Listing. Highlight it to view its fields, then
you can swap in the new texture by double clicking 'Texture – Blend,'
as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./030_Texture_Sets/image10.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Altering Bel’Shir Terrain Type</p>

<p>This will launch an 'Object Values' window annotated with ‘Textures –
Blend.’</p>

<p><img src="./030_Texture_Sets/image11.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Terrain Type Definition View</p>

<p>This editor lists the ‘Texture Library’ of all available Terrain
Textures and the currently selected Terrain Type in two parallel
listings. The intermediary controls allow textures to be added, removed,
reoriented, and swapped back and forth between the library and the
texture set. Additionally the ‘Preview’ button, can be used to see the
‘Demo Texture’ with both its base texture and normal map combined.
Select ‘Demo Texture’ from the ‘Texture Library’, then highlight
‘Bel’Shir Dirt Light’ in the ‘Texture Set’ and hit ‘Replace.’ This
should swap the textures, as you can see in the image below.</p>

<p><img src="./030_Texture_Sets/image12.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Swapped Terrain Textures</p>

<p>Clicking ‘Ok’ at this stage will complete the Terrain Type update and
finalize the exercise.</p>

<h2 id="testing-the-custom-texture-set">TESTING THE CUSTOM TEXTURE SET</h2>

<p>Go back to the Terrain Editor and navigate to the brush tool in the
Terrain Palette. You should be greeted by a thumbnail preview of your
the ‘Demo Texture’ in the far left spot of the texture set. This will
look like the image below.</p>

<p><img src="./030_Texture_Sets/image13.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Customized Texture Set on Terrain Palette</p>

<p>The texture is now ready to be painted onto the terrain, so feel free to
start experimenting.</p>

<p><img src="./030_Texture_Sets/image14.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Volcanic Ash in Bel'Shir</p>

<p>You can test the foliage capabilities of this new texture by laying an
area of it down, then painting that area with the ‘Allow Foliage’
option. If you hit Generate Foliage, it should give you something
similar to the screenshot below.</p>

<p><img src="./030_Texture_Sets/image15.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Generated Shakuras Tree Foliage</p>
