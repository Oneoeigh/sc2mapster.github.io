<h1 id="time-of-day-lighting">TIME OF DAY LIGHTING</h1>

<p>As a real-time strategy game, StarCraft has many systems centered on
time. For lighting, there is a useful setting called Time of Day
Lighting. This system allows lighting to react to the passage of time,
altering its conditions to simulate the passing of day and night. The
cycle will repeat, unless told to stop, for as long as the game
persists. You can employ this as a tactic for establishing mood and
atmosphere, but it also supports a variety of gameplay features by
hooking into a set of Time of Day validators. This allows you to trigger
different effects as your game cycles through lighting effects.</p>

<h2 id="creating-time-of-day-lighting">CREATING TIME OF DAY LIGHTING</h2>

<p>Open the demo map provided with this article. Inside you’ll find a scene
featuring the exterior of a bar set against a backdrop of some burning
wreckage. Move to the Data Editor and open lighting tab by clicking the
green +, then navigating to Edit Art and Sound Data -&gt; Lights. Create a
new light by right-clicking inside the main view, and selecting Add
Light. Name the light ‘Time of Day Lighting’ and hit suggest to generate
an ID. Next, set the ‘Light Group’ to ‘Tilesets’ using the drop down.
This process should look like the image below.</p>

<p><img src="./029_Time_of_Day_Lighting/image1.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Light Creation</p>

<p>Click on your new light, then double click the field ‘Time of Day.’ This
field will be labelled ‘Time of Day Info Array’ if the Combine
Structural Values option is not activated. This will launch the ‘Object
Values’ window.</p>

<p>Inside this window you’ll see a list of all the current times of day for
which there are lighting behavior. Currently you will only see the value
00, a shorthand for 00:00:00. Times of day are recorded in military time
using the format HH:MM:SS, or hours, then minutes, then seconds. The 00
value is thereby equal to the zero hour, or midnight. If you only have
one value here, the time of day behavior is by default constant, meaning
that your game’s lighting will be constant.</p>

<p>Right-click inside the white box and select ‘Add Light’ to add a new
time of day. You can see an example of this below.</p>

<p><img src="./029_Time_of_Day_Lighting/image2.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Adding a Time of Day Light</p>

<p>Set this new light to 06:00:00 by clicking into the first term of the
‘Time’ field and writing 6. This field mirrors the HH:MM:SS format. Now,
add two more lights, 12:00:00 and 18:00:00, to create four times of day
in total. The finished array should look like this.</p>

<p><img src="./029_Time_of_Day_Lighting/image3.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Four Time of Day Lights in an Array</p>

<p>Click ‘Ok’ to close the window, updating the light in the Data Editor.
Now double click on the ‘Time of Day’ field again to repoen it. It’s
worth noting at this point that the lighting window is an interface that
requires a lot of updating. It pushes data directly to the Editor view,
creating a very useful dynamic rendering of lighting styles. Data and
trigger features that send information directly to the Editor can
occasionally get stuck. A few precautionary manual refreshes can really
help in avoiding this behavior, and that’s what you’ve just done.</p>

<p>Now, click on the first light of the array 00 to highlight it, then
click the ‘Modify Light’ button to open the current Light in the
Lighting Window.</p>

<p><img src="./029_Time_of_Day_Lighting/image4.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Light Opens in the Lighting Window</p>

<p>The lighting window will launch and then automatically show the selected
Time of Day light in a folder of the current Light. Note that the folder
is categorized by the Tileset type that you selected during light
creation. It’s quite common for the Lighting Window not to have been
updated with all of the Time of Day values in the array. If the folder
only contains the 00:00:00 value, refresh the window by highlighting
00:00:00, then right-clicking and selecting ‘Add Light to Set.’ This is
shown in the image below.</p>

<p><img src="./029_Time_of_Day_Lighting/image5.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Refreshing Light Set</p>

<p>The lighting window will update and should display five entries under
the ‘Time of Day Lighting’ set. Right-click the extra 00:00:00 light,
which was created to refresh the window, then select ‘Remove Light from
Set.’</p>

<p>Now you can configure your four time of day lights, setting different
properties for each one. The game uses time of day lighting as a sort of
plan. As time passes the game gradually changes the properties of its
lighting, shifting from its current values to the values of the next
light in the array. It repeats this process again and again, so that by
making realistic lights for each part of the day you’ll see a
recognisable day and night cycle develop.</p>

<p>Configuring light properties from scratch can be quite time consuming.
It’s often better to copy data from a pre-existing light and use that as
a base for modification. You can do this here by using some of the ‘Mar
Sara’ settings as the basis of your day and night lighting. Navigate to
the ‘Mar Sara Night Test’ folder and highlight the light inside. With
this light selected, copy its properties with Edit -&gt; Copy Light Set.</p>

<p><img src="./029_Time_of_Day_Lighting/image6.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Copying Light Set</p>

<p>Return to the 00:00:00 light in the ‘Time of Day Lighting’ set,
highlight it and paste in the copied data with Edit -&gt; Paste Light Set.
You can see this process in action in the image below and to the left,
while the light updated with the pasted properties is shown on the
right.</p>

<p><img src="./029_Time_of_Day_Lighting/image7.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Pasting Light Set – Pasted Light</p>

<p>Using the copied properties as a base, you can now configure the
00:00:00 point. Navigate to its Key tab and set H (Horizontal Angle) to
180, and V (Vertical Angle) to 80. Moving the light to this low, high
angle will help to create the dark atmosphere expected at 00:00:00, or
midnight. This should look like the image below.</p>

<p><img src="./029_Time_of_Day_Lighting/image8.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Key Lighting Being Set</p>

<p>To finish setting up this light, move to the Fill tab and set H to 45
and V to 45. Under the Back tab set H to 0 and V to 45. Now move to the
‘Mar Sara Day Test’ folder, highlight its 00:00:00 light and copy it.
Paste its values into the 06:00:00 light in the ‘Time of Day Lighting’
set. Navigate to the Global tab and set ‘Light Time of Day’ to 6 0 0.
This is the most important field to set for time of day lights. You
didn’t need to set it in the last example because the default value is 0
0 0. The image below shows how to set the value.</p>

<p><img src="./029_Time_of_Day_Lighting/image9.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Light Time of Day Being Set</p>

<p>For this light, set the Key H to 270 and the V to 350. Set the Fill H to
135 and the V to 5. Then set the Back H to 90 and the V to 45. These
settings give this light, which simulates the sunrise, very long shadows
and a lot of backing light on objects.</p>

<p>Repeat the process to finish out the last two lights with the following
inputs.</p>

<p>For the 12:00:00 light.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Copy the ‘Mar Sara Day Test’ 00:00:00 light to the ‘Time of Day
Lighting’ 12:00:00 light.</li>
  <li>Set the ‘Light Time of Day’ to 12 0 0.</li>
  <li>Set its Key H to 0 and the V to 275. Set its Fill H to 225 and V to
    <ol>
      <li>Set its Back H to 180 and V to 45.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This configures the light to be almost directly overhead, as if the sun
were at high noon.</p>

<p>For the 18:00:00 light.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Copy the ‘Mar Sara Night Test’ 00:00:00 light to the ‘Time of Day
Lighting’ 18:00:00 light.</li>
  <li>Set the ‘Light Time of Day’ to 18 0 0.</li>
  <li>Set its Key H to 90 and the V to 350. Set its Fill H to 315 and V to
    <ol>
      <li>Set its Back H to 270 and V to 45.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This sets the light to set in the west, making long shadows similar to
the 06:00:00 sunrise, but in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Close the Lighting Window and open the Data Editor. If it is not already
done, highlight the ‘Time of Day Light’ light.</p>

<p>Navigate to the ‘Time Per Game Loop’, and set it to 0 20 0, as in the
image below.</p>

<p><img src="./029_Time_of_Day_Lighting/image10.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Setting Game Loop Time</p>

<p>This value determines the amount of time taken by the full time of day
lighting cycle. Setting a short period of 20 seconds here will allow you
to preview the effects in the map test. Finally, navigate to the
‘Terrain Type’ tab, highlight ‘Agria (Jungle),’ and set the ‘Lighting’
to ‘Time of Day Lighting.’ This procedure is shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./029_Time_of_Day_Lighting/image11.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Enabling Custom Lighting in Terrain Type</p>

<p>Your lighting setup is now complete. Use the ‘Test Document’ function to
test the map. This should reveal an exaggerated day and night cycle in
which a night scene is broken by sunrise, the day quickly passes, the
sun sets, and the scene plunges back into night, repeating itself
indefinitely. This behavior is a result of the scene moving through the
four lighting set-ups quickly, blending their features from one to
another on a scale of about five seconds. To get a better idea of how
lights blend using time of day settings, feel free to examine the
individual lights using the Lighting Window.</p>

<p>You can see the results of this test run below.</p>
