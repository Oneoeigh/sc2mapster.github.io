<h1 id="units-layer">UNITS LAYER</h1>

<p>The Units Layer is where you can place units on the map and configure
them in various ways. While units may enter a game via triggers or other
sources, placing them directly in the Editor can be useful for designing
the look and feel of your game. You can access this layer from the
Terrain Bar, by clicking the icon shown below.</p>

<h2 id="unit-palette">UNIT PALETTE</h2>

<p>‘Unit’ is a very flexible term, usually referring to gameplay pieces
such as marines, zealots, and the like. These examples are in fact
units, but in the context of the Editor the term refers more broadly to
a data type. In this case, a unit is an entity that can be placed in the
Editor and used in the game. This includes traditional StarCraft units,
but it also includes visual props, destructible terrain, resources,
buildings, signs, and critters.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, the Units Layer is a great tool for setting up
the working parts of your game while completely avoiding any coding.
This can be great for absolute beginners, but it also offers users of
any experience level the ability to put together a quick mock-up. Every
unit you place in the Terrain Editor will be seen in game unless you
later modify or disable them using triggers. You can find, select, and
place units using the options present in the Units Palette, shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./021_Units_Layer/image2.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Units Palette</p>

<p>The main feature of the Units Palette is a listing of all units
available for placement in the map. This list is populated from the
map’s current structure of data, including its dependencies and any data
native to the current map. The list also gives you access to three
layers of filters, allowing you to find by player, object family, race,
and object type. You can see it in use in the image below.</p>

<p><img src="./021_Units_Layer/image3.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Finding Melee Structures</p>

<p>The palette also boasts some supplemental features. The Existing Object
list keeps a record of every unit you’ve placed on the map. It provides
details about each unit’s type, its owner, whether or not it belongs to
any current groups, and its visibility status. This can be very useful
for locating units in a crowded map or estimating the overall unit count
during performance troubleshooting. Finally, there is also a Preview,
which shows a rendering of the unit currently selected for placement.
You can reorient this view with the standard camera controls. These
features are shown in the image below.</p>

<p>Units Preview and Existing Object List</p>

<h2 id="placing-a-unit">PLACING A UNIT</h2>

<p>To place a unit, look to the unit palette listing and find a subject
either manually or using the search bar and filters. Try selecting a
Thor by typing into the search bar. Clicking on the unit and navigating
to the main viewport will show a transparent preview of the unit ready
to be placed.</p>

<p><img src="./021_Units_Layer/image5.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Unit Placement Preview</p>

<p>Click again to place the unit, it should turn solid and will now show up
in the Existing Object list.</p>

<h2 id="configuring-a-placed-unit">CONFIGURING A PLACED UNIT</h2>

<p>When placing units in the Terrain Editor, you also unwrap some of their
properties for easy configuration. You can edit the Thor’s properties by
double clicking on it the main viewport. This will launch the ‘Object
Properties’ window, shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./021_Units_Layer/image6.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Unit’s Object Properties</p>

<p>The Object Properties window allow you to make a variety of adjustments
to a selected Unit. The options displayed may vary depending on what
unit you're working with. Below you’ll find a breakdown of the
properties this window allows you to edit.</p>

<hr />
<p>Property   Description
  ———- ————————————————————–
  Name       Applies a custom label to the specified unit. This label is
             visible in the Existing Object list.</p>

<p>Player     Sets ownership of the unit.</p>

<p>Position   Sets the location of the unit in the map via X and Y
             coordinates.</p>

<p>Rotation   Adjusts the facing angle of the unit in the Editor.
  ————————————————————————-</p>

<p>As an exercise demonstrating the utility of these features, place a few
more Thors on the map using the previous procedure. Edit the object
properties of each of these units and make sure they have all their
Player values to Player 1. Now select the single original Thor and set
is ownership to Player 3. Use its object property Name to give it the
label TEST UNIT. If you check the Existing Object list, the labelled
unit should be clearly differentiated, as in the image below.</p>

<p><img src="./021_Units_Layer/image7.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Labelled Unit</p>

<p>Go back to the Thor assigned to Player 3 and change its ownership to
Player 1. Shuffle the Thors together by moving them around on the Units
Layer. You can even set the units so that they are all facing the same
direction using their Rotation property, making them all appear
identical. Note that a unit at a 270° Rotation will face the camera. You
should be left with something that looks like this.</p>

<p><img src="./021_Units_Layer/image8.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Unit located with Name Property</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances, these units would be indistinguishable. In
this instance, the label you assigned to the Thor is still visible in
the Palette Existing Object list, and this will help you to locate your
unique Thor after the shuffle. If you had given this unit some special
gameplay significance, being referenced in triggers for example, then
the ability to find it in the Terrain Module quickly is particularly
useful.</p>
