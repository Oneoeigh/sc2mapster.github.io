<h1 id="sounds">SOUNDS</h1>

<p>Sound is the primary audio datatype of the Editor. It can represent
either an individual file or collection of audio files, and is the
source of almost every type of sound heard within the game. Things like
music, sound effects, unit voiceovers, and narrative dialog are all
stored in the game as a Sound type. This type is a building block asset,
it takes raw files from data or import and configures them, readying
them for play. These sound assets are then incorporated into gameplay
using either a sound actor or direct operation through triggers. You can
see a typical view of Sounds being manipulated in the Data Editor below.</p>

<p><img src="./076_Sounds/image1.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Sound Data View</p>

<h2 id="finding-sounds-in-the-data-editor">FINDING SOUNDS IN THE DATA EDITOR</h2>

<p>As a datatype, sounds are handled through the Data Editor. Once inside
this module, you can open the sounds tab by selecting the green + and
navigating to Edit Art and Sound Data -&gt; Sounds, as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./076_Sounds/image2.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Navigating to Sounds in Data</p>

<p>You should note that sounds differ from the data type Soundtracks. That
type is largely designed for in-game ambient music and cinematic
scoring. Opening the Sounds data tab will present you with the following
view.</p>

<p><img src="./076_Sounds/image3.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Sounds Data Listing</p>

<h2 id="sound-categories">SOUND CATEGORIES</h2>

<p>The sounds tab is organized in the same way as any other datatype tab in
the Data Editor. It is divided in two, with the left being a list of
every sound in the current data scope, while the right offers a detailed
view of the currently selected sound with all its fields available for
review. The sound listing is shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./076_Sounds/image4.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Sounds Category View</p>

<p>The sounds tab is separated into five categories for organization,
described in following table.</p>

<hr />
<p>Field        Details
  ———— ———————————————————-
  Sound Name   The name of the sound object.</p>

<p>Source       The data source in which the sound object is located.</p>

<p>#           The sound object’s index in the current scope.</p>

<p>Race         A race the sound object has been tagged to be associated
               with.</p>

<p>Parent       The template basis of the sound object.
  ———————————————————————–</p>

<p>The Sound Name is often broken into a prefix and suffix with the format
Unit_SoundType. This allows the listing to be further broken down by
unit and the types of sounds required for each unit. Some examples shown
above view are Refinery_Explode, Refinery_Ready, and Refinery_What.
These three sounds are each connected to the refinery unit and are
intended for three states that trigger sound.</p>

<h2 id="sounds-detail-view">SOUNDS DETAIL VIEW</h2>

<p>The basic view of the sound fields in the Editor will look as follows.</p>

<p><img src="./076_Sounds/image5.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Sound Fields</p>

<p>Here, the type is broken down into a variety of property fields and the
‘Sound Assets’ field, which contains the base sound file links. These
sound assets are brought into the Editor in two formats, .ogg and .wav.
The .ogg format makes up the majority of the sounds. Once inside the
Editor, these assets must be made part of a Sound via this ‘Sound
Assets’ field before they are useable in game.</p>

<p>Beyond illustrating this point, the basic view of the sound’s fields
doesn’t offer an awful lot. Due to the number of files that can be
packed into each Sound type, a much more extensive view was designed for
this tab of the data editor. You can access it by switching the Data
Editor into ‘Detail View,’ using the Data Bar. The button for this is
shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./076_Sounds/image6.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Detail View Button</p>

<p>Once you have the detail view set up, highlighting a Sound in the sounds
tab should present you with the following, hereafter referred to as the
Sound Editor.</p>

<p><img src="./076_Sounds/image7.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Sound Editor View</p>

<h2 id="sound-editor">SOUND EDITOR</h2>

<p>The enhanced Sound Editor view gives you a much more useful look at the
Sound datatype. Take note of the ‘Sound Assets’ box at the top of the
editor as it’s seen below.</p>

<p><img src="./076_Sounds/image8.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Sound Assets Close-Up</p>

<p>The topmost box here shows the contents of the sound’s ‘Sound Assets’
field. As previously described, this can contain one or multiple raw
sound files, which in this case are .ogg. You’ll also find the
individual Pitch, Volume, and Weight values for each asset in this view.
Further down are the individual controls that set these values, as well
as some supporting options. These are broken down in the following
table.</p>

<hr />
<p>Field    Details
  ——– —————————————————————–
  Select   Selects the play method for previewing sound assets as Sequential
  Method   or Shuffle. Most in-game sounds use Shuffle to produce varied
           response noises. One notable exception is the _Pissed series of
           sounds for each unit, which uses Sequential.</p>

<p>Mode     Selects the playing mode as 2D or 3D sound.</p>

<p>Pitch    Sets the pitch alteration of the raw sound using a slider.</p>

<p>Volume   Sets the volume alteration of the raw sound using a slider.</p>

<p>Weight   Sets a value from 0-100, which determines the Chance to Play.</p>

<p>Chance   The weight of this sound asset divided by the total weight of all
  to Play  sound assets within the Sound. This works out to the percentage
           chance this sound will be played anytime the object is used.
  ————————————————————————–</p>

<p>As you may have guessed while reading the properties above, a Sound
composed of multiple sound assets will play a random one of its
component sound files each time it is used in the game. The random
chance is dependent on the individual Weight of each asset and is
expressed exactly as a Chance to Play.</p>

<p>At the bottom of this section of the editor, you’ll find eight flags
that can be configured inside any Sound. These flags offer additional
modifications to the sound’s organizational properties, including its
file handling, streaming status, and ability to be paused.</p>

<h2 id="play-controls">PLAY CONTROLS</h2>

<p>One of the most important features of the Sound Editor is its set of
preview controls for sounds and sound editing. These are shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./076_Sounds/image9.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Play Controls Interface</p>

<p>These controls allow you to listen to raw sounds through the ‘Asset
Preview’ button, while also giving you the option to test altered sounds
with the ‘In-game Preview’ button. Having both of these features
available is important when you’re working with imported sound assets.
Without such a feature, it would be extremely onerous to find the proper
volume balance or effects controls for making custom assets sound right
in-game.</p>

<h2 id="sound-group-volume-controls">SOUND GROUP VOLUME CONTROLS</h2>

<p>Another section of the sound editor gives you the ability to set group
volume controls. These controls are shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./076_Sounds/image10.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Sounds Group Volume Controls</p>

<p>Sound groups offer an additional level of control for sound properties
by allowing you to add individual sound assets to a specific channel.
This channel can then be altered with an extensive level of sound
options, which are best demonstrated and understood through
experimentation with the preview controls. Below you can see a table
showing the many channels available for use.</p>

<hr />
<p>Alert        Alert           Build              Combat
  ———— ————— —————— ————–
  Death        Dialogue        Doodad             Flames</p>

<p>Foliage      Gather          Master Effects     Missions</p>

<p>Movement     Movie           Music              Other</p>

<p>Ready        Set Ambient     Set Emitters       Set Pieces</p>

<p>Spell        TV              UI                 Voice
  ————————————————————–</p>

<p>It’s worth noting here that sound channels can be affected by players’
personal settings. For example, if a player has their music disabled,
they will not hear any sound that is in the music channel.</p>

<p>One consequence of the extensive controls found in the Sound Editor is a
common confusion between the group sound controls and the individual
sound options. The image below should help you to avoid this confusion.</p>

<p><img src="./076_Sounds/image11.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Individual and Group Volume Controls</p>

<p>The individual volume controls used to set each sound asset’s volume are
found in the upper highlighted box. The lower highlighted box allows you
to set the sound alteration for each channel.</p>

<h2 id="sound-properties">SOUND PROPERTIES</h2>

<p>Selecting any individual file from the ‘Sound Assets’ box and double
clicking it will open a new window called ‘Sound Properties,’ as shown
below.</p>

<p><img src="./076_Sounds/image12.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Sound Properties View</p>

<p>Here you’ll find a number of important secondary controls dealing with
how and when a sound asset will play. The Loop Count controls how many
times a specific asset will play in a row when used in-game. Usually,
most sounds won’t need to be played more than once, but there are
exceptions.</p>

<p>Importantly music files are usually set on a constant loop during
gameplay. To get this specific behavior, set the Loop Count to -1. Loop
Time supports this by setting a random minimum and maximum length for a
loop playthrough. Offset will apply a random offset in between its
minimum and maximum to the sound file’s playback. The Speaker and
Animation controls are configured for narrative dialogue. They allow you
to tag a piece of pre-recorded audio with information and details that
can be useful in setting up a story-type campaign or cinematic.</p>

<h2 id="sound-editor-data-view">SOUND EDITOR DATA VIEW</h2>

<p>If you look to the top tabs of the Sound Editor, you’ll find another set
of useful options under the data tab. These options are shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./076_Sounds/image13.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Sounds Editor Data Tab</p>

<p>These controls allow you to set the speaker-centric volume properties of
each sound. Due to the vast number of options, the best way for you to
figure out how to use this panel is to experiment with the play
controls.</p>
