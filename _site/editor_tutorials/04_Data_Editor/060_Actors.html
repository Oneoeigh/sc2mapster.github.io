<h1 id="actors">ACTORS</h1>

<p>Actors are the workhorse of the Data Editor. They are both essential and
wide-ranging, so much so that it can be difficult to pin an exact
definition to them. Actors can be more easily defined in terms of their
purpose. To put it as simply as possible, actors accomplish things
within data.</p>

<p>Actors have their own logic system, which is responsible for much of the
linking and action between data. Some actors hook together the
observable components of the engine, such as models, doodads, and sound,
tying them into the game. Other actors affect gameplay by configuring
attacks and abilities. There’s even a variety of higher level constructs
for use with actors, including actor lists that track and organize
actors, actor regions that can interact with other actors based on a map
area, and event macros that collect common actor logic into a reusable
tool. Actors are also the asynchronous component of the StarCraft
engine, allowing them to push different data to different players.</p>

<p>You can find the actors section of the Editor by moving to the Data
Editor and navigating to + -&gt; Edit Actor Data -&gt; Actors, as shown
below.</p>

<p><img src="./060_Actors/image4.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Navigating to Actors in Data</p>

<p>This will bring you to the actors tab of the Data Editor, presenting you
with the following view.</p>

<p>Actors Tab View</p>

<p>The fields in actors are described in the following section.</p>

<h2 id="actor-details">ACTOR DETAILS</h2>

<p>Owing to the many types available for actors, a single treatment of
every actor property would be too unwieldy to be useful. However, actors
have a large list of common properties, which are broken down in the
table below.</p>

<hr />
<p>Field        Details
  ———— ——————————————————————
  Aliases      Alternate reference names for actors. These offer a shortcut,
               making it easy for actors to send messages to one another. For
               example, unit actors have a common _Unit alias. When a separate
               actor wants to access the unit actor, it may use this alias. This
               is preferable to looking up the actual actor name, which will
               differ each time.</p>

<p>Copy Source  Sets another actor as a proxy parent. This means that any child
               actors of the current actor will acquire their properties from the
               Copy Source actor. The properties to be acquired must be set in
               the Copy Source actor’s Accepted Property Transfers field and the
               child actor’s Inherited Properties field.</p>

<p>Filter       Sets the visibility of the actor to Ally, Enemy, Neutral, or Self
               groups of the actor’s owner.</p>

<p>Filter       Sets the visibility of the actor on a player basis.
  Player</p>

<p>Flags        Flags contains a number of additional options for the actor.</p>

<p>Add to       Moves the actor to a global scope, making it usable by all other
  External     actors in the game.
  Finder</p>

<p>Not Saved    Marks the actor to not save or load during a game save, reducing
               the time of these operations.</p>

<p>Response to  Sets the actor to automatically update its player ID when its unit
  Unit Player  actor changes owner.</p>

<p>Suppress     Turns off the actor’s creation error message. This is useful if an
  Creation     actor is designed to fail its creation event under certain
  Errors       circumstances.</p>

<p>Fog          Sets the actor’s appearance under fog of war. The behavior options
  Visibility   are as follows: Dimmed appears darkened, Hidden hides the actor
               completely, Snapshot will show the actor’s last visible state
               before leaving vision, and Visible makes the actor remain visible
               under fog.</p>

<p>Sharing      Sets the behavior for sharing the actor if it is requested by
               multiple functions. The options are: Always shared, Never shared,
               and Per Effect. Per Effect allows the you to configure sharing on
               an effect basis.</p>

<p>Events       Allows the setting of actor events and messages, which are the
               internal logic language for actors.</p>

<p>Macros       Can add event macros here. Event macros are a collection of common
               Events that are reusable in many actors.</p>

<p>Remove       Specify the removal of unwanted Events inherited from the parent
               actor.</p>

<p>Terms        Sets conditions that must be passed for the actor to be created.
               Identical to the term of the creation event within Events and will
               overwrite that message if entered here. This has an application in
               data organization.</p>

<p>Host         Host Supporter is used to specify a supporter actor. When the
  Supporter    supporter dies a SupporterDesctruction message is sent to the
               actor which hosted it. This is often used to destroy that hosting
               actor, but can also be used to play animations or propagate
               messages.</p>

<p>Accepted     Determines which of a set of properties will be passed on to child
  Property     actors. Controlled via a set of flags. Some of the numerous
  Transfers    options here include Model Scale, Opacity, Scale, Team Color,
               Visibility, and Decal. There are even more transfer properties
               within the continuation field, Accepted Transfers. Options within
               Accepted Transfers include Animation Properties, Fog of War Color,
               Position, Rotation, and Textures.</p>

<p>Inherit Type Sets if the actor inherits its properties from its host on
               creation via Once, never via None, or in a dynamically updating
               fashion via Continuous.</p>

<p>Inherited    Determines the set of properties this actor inherits from its
  Properties   parent actor. For a property to be inherited correctly, it must be
               selected in both the Inherited Properties and Accepted Property
               Transfers fields.

<h2 id="actor-events">ACTOR EVENTS</h2>

<p>Actor Events is a communication system for actors. It allows for actors
to speak to one another, creating context sensitive changes that can
affect any aspect of the game. This system is composed of three basic
elements, which are described below.</p>

<p><img src="./060_Actors/image3.png" alt="Image" /> A specific development that can occur
within the game.</p>

<p><img src="./060_Actors/image3.png" alt="Image" /> A confirmable set of properties of the
game state.</p>

<p><img src="./060_Actors/image3.png" alt="Image" /> Commands that can be communicated to
elements of the game.</p>

<p>These elements work together in a sequence, creating an actor event. The
sequence unfolds as follows. Setting an actor’s events makes the actor
watch for a specific Event to occur. If it does, then the Terms are
checked. If they are found to be true, the Messages are sent out to
their targeted game elements.</p>

<p>You may already have noticed that this is similar the Editor’s other
main communication system, triggers. The events, terms, and messages of
the actor events system are parallel to the events, conditions, and
actions of the trigger system. While the trigger system can apply to
many gameplay elements, the actor events system deals primarily with
data. Triggers are usually the option for specific instances of units,
objects, and occurrences in a map. Actor events work for the general
type of an object. Actor events design a unit and its interactions,
while triggers can adjust and alter that unit during gameplay.</p>

<p>You can find the actor events system by navigating to the ‘Events’ field
of any actor type. A view of a typical events field is shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./060_Actors/image6.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Actor Events Field</p>

<p>Double clicking this field will launch the actor events subeditor.</p>

<p><img src="./060_Actors/image7.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Actor Events Subeditor</p>

<p>This subeditor presents an organized view of the events, terms, and
messages in an actor’s ‘Events’ field. You should note that the elements
are colorized by their data source. Gray elements indicate inheritance
from the game’s core data, Blue elements are from a Blizzard dependency,
and green elements are from the current project.</p>

<h2 id="actor-event-use">ACTOR EVENT USE</h2>

<p>You can set actor events by highlighting an element in the subeditor
view, then selecting its type via the rightmost panel’s ‘Msg Type’ or
‘Term Type’ dropdowns. Note that both events and messages are referred
to using the term ‘message.’ This is because they’re interchangeable,
messages can be used as event triggers and vice versa.</p>

<p>Additional options, such as parameters or sources, typically control
what the messages are communicating to. Any messages without a target
will be sent by the actor to itself. Messages can also be targeted more
granularly through the use of aliases. Although actors can be referred
to by their direct name such as Marine, they usually have a type alias
like _Unit, and a system reference like ::Creator.</p>

<p>Actor events are incredibly versatile. They can perform the fundamental
handling of actors within data, such as creating them, destroying them,
and linking them. However, actor events have many more nuanced
functions, like playing animations, altering the physical properties of
art and sound assets, applying physics, and controlling lighting. As an
example of actor events’ capabilities, note the following.</p>

<p><img src="./060_Actors/image8.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Sample Actor Event</p>

<p>Here, an event has been set to respond to a zealot’s charging behavior.
In response to the charge starting, the zealot will send out a message
to its own unit actor, resulting in its model being tinted to a reddish
color. On testing, the gameplay results appeared as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./060_Actors/image9.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Zealots Tinting an Angry Red during Charge</p>

<h2 id="actor-events--triggers">ACTOR EVENTS &amp; TRIGGERS</h2>

<p>As mentioned earlier, there are many parallels between the actor events
and trigger systems despite their dealing with different segments of the
game. While it can be useful to keep the two separate in your thinking,
the fact is that the two systems frequently communicate with one
another, overlap in functionality, and can be used to accomplish the
same things in several different ways.</p>

<p>An important example of this is that actor messages can be sent to
specific actors using the Trigger Editor’s ‘Send Actor Message’ action.
You can see this in action below.</p>

<p><img src="./060_Actors/image10.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>‘Send Actor Message’ Actions</p>

<p>Above, an action statement in the body of a trigger has sent out a ‘Set
Tint Color’ message to a hydralisk’s unit actor. The unit actor has also
received a message to change its team color. Together, these messages
have dyed the unit’s model a blue color, by speaking directly to its
actors from triggers.</p>
