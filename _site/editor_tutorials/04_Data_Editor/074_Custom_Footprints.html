<h1 id="custom-footprints">CUSTOM FOOTPRINTS</h1>

<p>The Editor features a wide range of footprints that are often repurposed
in the creation of new objects, actors, and units. That said, it can
still be useful to understand how to create a custom footprint. This
will allow you to create footprint designs with custom shapes and
pathing for very specific applications.</p>

<h2 id="pathing-grid">PATHING GRID</h2>

<p>Footprints apply pathing logic to the map in terms of map units. It can
be difficult to visualize the units of the StarCraft engine, but
fortunately the Editor provides some utilities to help you. First,
enable all of the pathing layer visibility options by navigating to View
-&gt; Show Pathing and checking each category, as shown below. Then
navigate to View -&gt; Show Pathing Grid and enable all of the options
there too.</p>

<p><img src="./074_Custom_Footprints/image1.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Turning Visibility Options On</p>

<p>You should now be able to see the full pathing grid in the Editor. Green
indicates pathable areas, while red shows the areas which are not
pathable. The squares depicted in the grid each represent a 1 by 1 unit
area, the same unit scale in which maps are created. This means a 96x96
map equates to a unit grid scale of 96 units squared. Footprints must
adhere to the unit grid. This makes it very useful for figuring out
placements and understanding the requirements for a specific custom
footprint. You can see the grid in the images below.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-footprint">CREATING A FOOTPRINT</h2>

<p>To create a footprint first move to the Data Editor. If the ‘Footprints’
tab is not already open, add it by navigating to + -&gt; Edit Game Data
-&gt; Footprints. Right-click in the main data view and select ‘Add
Footprint.’ This should give you the following view.</p>

<p><img src="./074_Custom_Footprints/image3.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Adding Footprint in Data</p>

<p>This will launch the ‘Footprint Properties’ window. For this exercise,
you’ll create a custom footprint in an octagonal shape. Enter ‘Octagon
3x3’ as the ‘Name’ field for the pop up, click suggest to generate an
ID, then click ‘Ok.’</p>

<p><img src="./074_Custom_Footprints/image4.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Footprint Properties Window</p>

<p>Once you’ve returned to the main Data Editor view, navigate to the
‘Layers’ field of the newly created footprint and double click it to
launch the Footprint Editor.</p>

<p>Launching Footprint Editor</p>

<h2 id="footprint-editor">FOOTPRINT EDITOR</h2>

<p><img src="./074_Custom_Footprints/image6.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Editor View</p>

<p>The Footprint Editor offers a specific tool for creating footprints and
controlling their pathing and placement logic. It’s a little off the
beaten path, but you can access it from either of the two fields in the
‘Footprints’ data type, ‘Layers’ and ‘Shapes.’ Selecting either of these
fields launch will launch the same editor. This is because the Footprint
Editor populates itself with the data from both the layer and shape
fields for a single footprint object. Note that manually editing the
footprint data and avoiding this subeditor is still an option. However,
it is often more intuitive do so using the footprint editor due to the
visual nature of footprints. The properties of the subeditor are broken
down in the table below.</p>

<hr />
<p>Property     Effect
  ———— ——————————————————————–
  Size         Sets the unit grid size of the footprint.</p>

<p>Value        Selects a pathing type to be applied. Choices include None, No
               Building, Unpathable Terrain, Ground, and Cliff. The None setting is
               the default value for all units of the map.</p>

<p>Brush Size   Sets the pathing application area in cells. The settings are
               Triangle: 1 cell, Sub-cell: 4 cells, and Cell: 16 cells.</p>

<p>Resolution   Sets the number of cells which can be pathed within a single unit.
               The settings are Large (4 cells per unit), Medium (16 cells per
               unit), Small (64 cells per unit), and Tiny (256 cells per unit).</p>

<p>Layer        Sets the logic layer being altered. Options include Pathing,
               Placement Apply, and Placement Check. This will be described in more
               detail later in the article.</p>

<p>Unit         Selects a preview model to test footprint size. Model will list the
               unit path, while Facing and Scale allow you to alter the model’s
               properties.</p>

<p>Complexity   An estimate of the footprint’s performance cost. Increasing
               Resolution, using many pathing types, and creating unusual geometry
               are the primary concerns here.</p>

<p>Type         Selects the footprint’s main behavior from Standard, Overlay, or
               Persistent. Standard overlays are by far the most common and alter
               pathing on the same level of cliff height. Overlay footprints alter
               non-ground pathing and are seldom used. Persistent footprints cannot
               be removed during gameplay, only altered. They usually see use with
               bridge objects.
  ———————————————————————————</p>

<p>Pathing is created in the subeditor in three separate layers, Pathing,
Placement Apply, and Placement Check. Pathing allows for the size,
shape, and type of pathing to be determined. This is the layer visible
in the grid view of the Terrain Editor. It’s worth noting that multiple
pathing types are supported within a single cell. This isn’t immediately
obvious, as the subeditor will only show the first painted color. Once
you have designed a pathing footprint, you may find that you need to
close the Editor and reload the map before it will show any updated
footprints in the Terrain Editor.</p>

<p>The placement layers, Placement Apply and Placement Check, affect the
application of specific placement flags. Each of these allows you to set
four distinct layers of options. Placement Apply will apply these
options to the area on the map within its footprint. Placement Check
requires the options to exist within the set areas or the object owning
the footprint cannot be created. You should be aware that, for the
option layers to be painted on the footprint, they must first be set
using ‘Define Sets.’ Clicking this button will launch a ‘Footprint Set
Definitions’ window. Be careful, make sure to use the dropdown at the
top of the window to select the proper layer being set. A typical view
of this layer is shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./074_Custom_Footprints/image7.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Placement Application Layer and Definition Popup</p>

<p>Now, head back to the ‘Octagon 3x3’ footprint and paint an octagonal
footprint using the pathings No Building and Unpathable Terrain. As a
hint, you should use the Tiny resolution and make the triangular cutouts
have a base length of six cells. The result should look as pictured
below.</p>

<p><img src="./074_Custom_Footprints/image8.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Hexagon 3x3 Pathing</p>

<h2 id="linking-a-footprint-to-an-object">LINKING A FOOTPRINT TO AN OBJECT</h2>

<p>Now that you’ve created your custom footprint, you’ll place it inside a
doodad for testing. Navigate to the actors tab within the Data Editor
and select the ‘Ice World Rock Large’ doodad. Highlight the ‘Footprint’
field and double click it to launch the ‘Object Values’ window. Find
your ‘Octagon 3x3’ footprint, select it, and hit ‘Ok’. This should leave
you with the following.</p>

<p><img src="./074_Custom_Footprints/image9.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Adding Footprint in Data</p>

<p>Testing the doodad in the Terrain Editor should give an updated
footprint, which differs from the doodad’s square 3x3 default. Locate
the doodad within the Doodads Layer, select it, and place it in the map
to investigate. If the footprint has not yet updated or remains blank,
you may have to try closing the Editor and relaunching. The footprint in
its before and after states should appear as shown below.</p>
