<h1 id="sound-actors">SOUND ACTORS</h1>

<p>Sound Actors are used to deliver most of the game’s unit sounds. This
includes things like order affirmations, weapons fire, death cries,
spell effects, and construction noises. There are other sounds in the
games, such as music and cutscene dialog, but sounds actors handle the
systemic sounds that respond to gameplay. As a type of actor, sound
actors can be located in the actors tab, shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./063_Sound_Actors/image1.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Sound Actors Listing</p>

<p>Sound actors don’t actually contain their sound asset, it is stored
separately in a Sound data type. As such, you can think of sound actors
as a kind of sound coordinator. They act in response to the game’s
inputs via their connection to a unit, then start and stop sounds as
directed by their ‘Events’ field. They have a limited ability to
configure their sound. Any alterations to a sound’s properties, like
pitch, volume, or 3D settings, typically occur in the Sound data.</p>

<p>There are two base types of sound actor that are used for sound actor
parentage, SoundOneShot and SoundContinuous. The former is used for
sounds that only play once, while the latter is for sounds that play
indefinitely. For example, the the Zerg burrow noise is a one shot
sound, while the medivac healing loop is a continuous sound.</p>

<h2 id="sound-actor-fields">SOUND ACTOR FIELDS</h2>

<p>A sound actor’s fields create a link between the sound actor itself, a
unit, and a sound asset. These fields are broken down in the table
below.</p>

<hr />
<p>Field        Details
  ———— ——————————————————————-
  Events       Sets the actor events. Sound actors use events to create themselves
               and their link to a unit. The control of Sound objects is also
               handled through events.</p>

<p>Sound        Sets the Sound played on actor creation. Any base behavior present
               in the sound is maintained here, including looping, variations, and
               volume controls.</p>

<p>Sound Flags  Contains a single Update Visibility flag. This flag makes use of
               actors’ ability to be asynchronous. When activated, sounds will
               respond to their visibility status for a player. For example, if a
               sound is playing as a unit vanishes from a player’s view into fog
               of war, the sound’s volume will fade out. This flag is often
               disabled for unit death sounds so that players can hear the full
               death sound of a unit, even if it disappears under the fog of war.</p>

<p>Host         Determines which properties are inherited from the host. Properties
               like positon and height are important to any sounds configured to
               be 3D.</p>

<p>Host Site    Site operations can be used to alter the sound’s position in 3D
  Operations   space.
  ——————————————————————————–</p>

<h2 id="sound-actor-events">SOUND ACTOR EVENTS</h2>

<p>Events and messages pertinent to a sound actor’s operation are broken
down in the table below.</p>

<hr />
<p>Message     Description
  ———– ———————————————————–
  Create      Creates the actor, playing the sound with its specified
              properties.</p>

<p>Destroy     Destroys the actor, ending sound output.</p>

<p>Timer Set   Sometimes used to play a sound after the actor’s creation,</p>

<p>Sound Done  Operates as an event, where it is triggered once a sound
              has finished playing. Usually used to Destroy the actor. A
              looping sound will not trigger this.</p>

<p>Sound Add   Modifies a sound with digital signal processing. There are
  Digital     a number of preconfigured DSP effects such as
  Effects     ReverbUnderwater and ReverbStoneRoom.</p>

<p>Sound Set   Mutes or unmutes a sound. A muted sound continues to play,
  Muted       but at effectively zero volume.</p>

<p>Sound Set   Creates an offset, or pause before the sound begins
  Offset      playing.</p>

<p>Sound Set   Pauses or unpauses a sound. A paused sound’s output stops
  Paused      until begun again.</p>

<p>Sound Set   Alters the pitch of a sound over time, making it higher or
  Pitch       lower.</p>

<p>Sound Set   Sets the volume of a sound over time.
  Volume    <br />

<h2 id="demoing-sound-actors">DEMOING SOUND ACTORS</h2>

<p>Open the demo map provided with this article. The course inside shows a
roach that’s been cornered by some marines. It should appear as shown in
the image below.</p>

<p><img src="./063_Sound_Actors/image2.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Sound Actors Listing</p>

<p>By default, roaches don’t make any sort of noise while being attacked.
Testing the map now will demonstrate this. However, you can build a new
sound actor to alter this behavior using some prebuilt assets. Navigate
to the Data Editor and open the Sounds tab. Find the existing sound
‘Roach_Damaged,’ and open its ‘Sounds Assets’ field. This should
present you with the following view.</p>

<p><img src="./063_Sound_Actors/image3.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Sound Actors Listing</p>

<p>Here a custom Sound has been set up to replicate a selection of zergling
death noises. The list is set so that a random variation will pick and
play as a stand in for a roach damaged noise. To set that functionality,
move to the actors tab and right-click in the main view, then select
‘Add Actor.’</p>

<p><img src="./063_Sound_Actors/image4.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Creating an Actor</p>

<p>Name the new actor ‘Roach Damaged,’ then click ‘Suggest’ to generate an
ID. Use the ‘Actor Type’ dropdown to select the creation of a sound
actor, as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./063_Sound_Actors/image5.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Selecting Sound Actor Creation</p>

<p>Select the ‘Parent’ to be SoundOneShot, since the behavior you want is
for the sound to play once on being attacked, then stop. The final actor
creation window will look something like this.</p>

<p><img src="./063_Sound_Actors/image6.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Sound Actor Creation Window</p>

<p>Now highlight the actor you just created and find its ‘Event’s field.
Select this field and double click it to open the actor events
subeditor. You’ll see that there is a pre-existing ‘SoundDone’ event
with a ‘Destroy’ message. This is parented in from the SoundOneShot base
and will cause the sound to stop, or be destroyed, after playing once.
Right-click below this element and select ‘Add Event’, as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./063_Sound_Actors/image7.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Adding an Event</p>

<p>Once created, highlight the new ‘ActionDamage’ event and use the
dropdown to set the Event’s Msg Type to ‘Unit Damage.’</p>

<p><img src="./063_Sound_Actors/image8.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Selecting Event Type</p>

<p>Set the ‘Unit Damage’ event’s Source Name to ‘Roach.’ Then set the
message to ‘Create.’ This will establish the link with the roach,
causing the actor to be created and play every time the roach is
damaged. The completed actor events should look like those in the image
below.</p>

<p><img src="./063_Sound_Actors/image9.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Completed Actor Events</p>

<p>Click ‘Ok’ to save the actor events, then move back to the main Data
Editor view. The sound actor still requires a connection to a sound
asset, so create the link by navigating to the ‘Sound’ field and double
clicking to open it.</p>

<p>This will launch an ‘Object Values’ window where you can set the sound.
At this point you should be looking at the following.</p>

<p><img src="./063_Sound_Actors/image10.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Setting Sound Asset</p>

<p>Select the ‘Roach Damaged’ Sound that was supplied with the map and
click ‘Ok.’ Now move to the ‘Terms’ field and double click to open it.
This field offers some additional terms, the same as found in actor
events. In this case, these terms must be passed before the actor is
created. Click the + button to add a new term, then use the dropdown to
select ‘Cap,’ as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./063_Sound_Actors/image11.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Setting Terms</p>

<p>Once selected, set the Cap value of this term to 2. This will appear as
follows.</p>

<p><img src="./063_Sound_Actors/image12.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Completed Term</p>

<p>This term sets a cap on the number of actors that can exist in the same
scope before another can be created. The scope here is the unit source,
the roach. This setup means that the roach can make a maximum of two
damaged sounds at any given time. Confirm these settings by clicking
‘Ok.’</p>

<p>The map is now complete. The sound actor has allowed you to introduce a
new sound into the roach’s data. You can see the changes in the unit’s
data structure below.</p>

<p><img src="./063_Sound_Actors/image13.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Old Roach Data Structure – New Roach Data Structure</p>

<p>The sound actor has linked the Sound ‘Roach Damaged’ into the Unit data
through its events, specifically the ‘Unit Create’ event, which will be
triggered on any damage to the roach. Testing this behavior should play
this new sound when any marines are commanded to attack the roach.
Remember that the sound is a sampling of the zergling death cry. Use
‘Test Document’ to see it working in-game.</p>
