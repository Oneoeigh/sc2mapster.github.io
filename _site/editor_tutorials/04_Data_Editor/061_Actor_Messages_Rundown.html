<h1 id="actor-messages-rundown">ACTOR MESSAGES RUNDOWN</h1>

<p>For nearly every data type, there is some associated actor message to
provide its logical backend. This guarantees that the stable of actor
messages is both diverse and numerous. In this article you’ll find a
breakdown of many of the types of messages, as well as some suggestions
for their use.</p>

<p>Before we start, you should note that you can see an actor’s messages
both directly, through the expandable ‘Events’ field, and structured
inside the actor event’s subeditor. Each entry in this article will also
include a view of the message type within the subeditor, but the basic
fields view can be sometimes be noteworthy as well. You can see an
example of this view in the image below.</p>

<p><img src="./061_Actor_Messages_Rundown/image1.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Actor Events Field</p>

<p>From here you can see the direct ID of actor messages, such as UnitBirth
or ActorCreation, rather than their structure form in the subeditor
selection panel of ‘Unit Birth’ or ‘Actor Creation.’ These IDs may be
important when using actor messages in the Trigger Editor or scripting.
As such, they have been supplied at the start of each of the following
entries.</p>

<p>While this article may serve as a reference, you should be aware that
best way to investigate the full library of actor messages is
individually, by creating and examining messages in the subeditor view
itself. You can create an actor event or message by moving to an actor’s
‘Events’ field, double clicking it to launch the subeditor, then
right-clicking inside the white box and selecting ‘Add Event.’ This will
create an event and message pair.</p>
