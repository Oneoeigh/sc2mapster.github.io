<h1 id="site-operations-rundown">SITE OPERATIONS RUNDOWN</h1>

<p>Site operations represent a substantial number of the modifications that
you can be apply to an actor. It will likely take some time and
experience before you have a firm grip on them. This is a brief guide on
employing the most commonly used operations to help you along the way.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that this guide differs a bit from previous rundowns of
Editor elements. This is because site operations differ from other
elements of the editor in that the order in which they’re applied
matters. Rearranging the same set of site operations can produce
markedly different results. This can mean that site operations are a bit
difficult to define in a vacuum. Rather than providing a breakdown of
each operation’s fields and details individually, this article defines
each operation and shows how to apply them in a tutorial exercise. This
will help you to gain insight into how a host actor changes as more site
operations are layered onto it.</p>

<p>Open the demo map provided with this article to start the tutorial.
Inside you’ll find a marine standing on a boardwalk roadway, as in the
image below.</p>

<p><img src="./067_Site_Operations_Rundown/image1.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Demo Map Course</p>

<p>Move to the Data Editor, then to the actors tab for first step of the
exercise.</p>

<h2 id="site-operation-attachment">SITE OPERATION (ATTACHMENT)</h2>

<p>The Attachment site operation attaches an actor either to a unit or to
another actor. This is usually used to give the appearance that the
actor’s models are linked or grafted together. You can stack this
grafting to create strange, chimaera-like units, which is perhaps the
most iconic use of site operations. A well-known example built with this
method is the Blizzard’s April Fools’ prank the Terratron.</p>

<p><img src="./067_Site_Operations_Rundown/image2.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Terratron: A Robot Built From Many Combined StarCraft Models</p>

<p>Before you try to understand the mechanics of this operation, it will
help to go over a few terms. The actor being attached, which hosts the
site operation, is known as the Host. The actor to which the Host is
being attached is known as the Base.</p>

<p>When creating an attachment site operation, the most important field is
the Attachment Query. You can use this field to set the type of
attachment point used. This is described in more detail in the table
below. Applying the attachment site operation to the Host will tell it
to send the Attachment Query to any Base it is connected to. This causes
the Host to be attached to the Base by its instance of the attachment
point type set by the Attachment Query. The operation then sets the
Host’s position and orientation to that of the Base’s attachment point.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that, since there is a limited number of attachment
point types, you’ll find a useful pre-built set of attachment site
operations already in the Data Editor. These typically have names with a
prefix of SOpAttach, and a suffix describing the name of an attachment
point type. Examples include SOpAttachHead, SOpAttachWeapon, and
SOpAttachCenter.</p>

<p>This table shows a breakdown of the attachment site operation’s fields.</p>

<hr />
<p>Field        Details
  ———— ——————————————————————-
  Attachment   Sets the attachment Methods, which specify the attachment point to
  Query        which the Host will be attached. This is set by selecting a ‘Filter
               Type.’ The options here are Direct, where the reference name of an
               attachment point is specified from a dropdown, and Method, where
               the point is specified from the Attach Methods data type. You can
               also provide a Fallback query in case the specified method fails.</p>

<p>Hold         This flag sets the position of the attachment to remain constant at
  Position     its initially calculated value.</p>

<p>Hold         This flag sets the rotation of the attachment to remain constant at
  Rotation     its initially calculated value.

<h2 id="using-an-attachment-operation">USING AN ATTACHMENT OPERATION</h2>

<p>The map provided with this article can be used to demonstrate attachment
operations, you can practice on the lone marine. He won’t mind. The
first thing you’ll need is a Model for the Host actor. You can create a
model by moving to the models tab in the Data Editor, right-clicking in
the Object List, and selecting ‘Add Model.’ This will launch the window
shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./067_Site_Operations_Rundown/image3.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Model Creation Window</p>

<p>Set the model’s ‘Name’ to ‘Light Model’ and hit ‘Suggest’ to auto
generate an ID. Set the ‘Model Type’ to ‘Generic’ and click ‘Ok.’ This
will create a Model object. Move to its ‘Model’ field and double click
it to launch an ‘Object Values’ selection window. Clicking ‘Browse’ in
this window will launch the Archive Browser, as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./067_Site_Operations_Rundown/image4.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Model Selection with Archive Browser</p>

<p>Use the browser’s search function to find Streetlight_01.m3, select it
and click ‘Ok.’ Click ‘Ok’ again in the selection window, to move back
to the main Data Editor view. The model asset has now been linked to a
Model type and is ready for use within an actor. Prepare the actor by
first moving to the actors tab. There, right-click in the object list
and select ‘Add Actor.’</p>

<p><img src="./067_Site_Operations_Rundown/image5.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Adding an Actor</p>

<p>Selecting ‘Add Actor’ will launch an ‘Actor Properties’ creation window.
In this window, set the ‘Name’ to ‘Marine Light’ and hit ‘Suggest’ to
auto generate an ID. You should also set the ‘Actor Type’ to ‘Model’ and
the ‘Parent’ to ‘ModelAddition.’ Click ‘Ok’ to create the actor. This
should with the window pictured below.</p>

<p><img src="./067_Site_Operations_Rundown/image6.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Model Actor Creation Window</p>

<p>Creating the model with the same name as the model actor will fill the
‘Model’ field for you, automatically creating the link. Now it’s time to
add the attachment site operation to this actor. You can do so by moving
to the ‘Host Site Operations’ field and double clicking on it to launch
the site operations subeditor.</p>

<p><img src="./067_Site_Operations_Rundown/image7.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Host Site Operation Subeditor</p>

<p>Clicking the ‘Choose’ button will launch the site operation selection
shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./067_Site_Operations_Rundown/image8.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Selecting Attachment Site Operation</p>

<p>In this case, you can use one of the pre-made attachment operations. The
series of site operations prefixed with SOpAttach each contains an
Attachment Query that targets a specific class of attachment point in a
unit. Select the SOPAttachHead operation, which targets the attachment
point in a model’s head. Then click ‘Ok’ to return to the previous view.</p>

<p><img src="./067_Site_Operations_Rundown/image9.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Selected Site Operation</p>

<p>The site operation has been added to the actor’s listing. Click ‘Ok’ to
finalize. The model actor now contains a custom streetlight model that
will be grafted to its Base unit’s head. All that remains is for you to
connect the actor to its host. You can do this using the actor events
field. Navigate to ‘Events’ within the ‘Marine Light’ model actor, and
double click the field to open the actor events subeditor view, shown
below.</p>

<p><img src="./067_Site_Operations_Rundown/image10.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Actor Events View</p>

<p>Right-click inside the white box and select ‘Add Event.’ Using the
dropdown, set the ‘Msg Type’ of the event to ‘Unit Birth.’ Then set the
‘Msg Type’ of the message to ‘Create’ and its ‘Source Name’ to ‘Marine.’
This should leave you with the following.</p>

<p><img src="./067_Site_Operations_Rundown/image11.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Linking Model Actor to Unit</p>

<p>Creating this actor event causes the ‘Marine Light’ model actor to link
to the ‘Marine’ unit actor at the time of unit creation. As described
earlier, this causes the ‘Marine’ actor to serve as the Base, the
‘Marine Light’ as the Host, and the SOpAttachHead as the attachment site
operation. The Model of the ‘Marine Unit’ Actor will now be grafted to
the Model of the ‘Marine Light’ Actor at the point of the
SOpAttachHead’s Attachment Query. The result of this operation is shown
in the image below.</p>

<p><img src="./067_Site_Operations_Rundown/image12.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Models Grafted Together with Attachment Operation</p>

<h2 id="site-operation-explicit-rotation">SITE OPERATION (EXPLICIT ROTATION)</h2>

<p>The Explicit Rotation site operation creates a rotation in a Host actor
on any combination of its three axes: x, y, and z. This is achieved
through the use of two vectors, Forward and Up. Each vector provides a
different base axis for rotation in the three cardinal directions. The
details of this operation are broken down in the table below.</p>

<hr />
<p>Fiel d Details
  —— —————————————————————-
  Forw   Provides a base rotation axis for rotation operations, which are
  ard    selected using the X, Y, and Z inputs. You can picture the
         Forward vector as protruding outwards from the actor, parallel
         to the ground. Input rotations are controlled by the following
         scheme.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     -X: Right +X: Left

     -Y: Forward +Y: Backwards

     -Z: Down +Z: Up

     This is a unit vector and all inputs are normalized on a scale
     of 1/-1. This vector sees much more use than the other option.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Up     Provides a base rotation axis for rotation operations, which are
         selected using the X, Y, and Z inputs. You can picture the Up
         vector as protruding upwards from the actor, as if emerging from
         the ground. Input rotations are controlled by the following
         scheme.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     -X: Right +X: Left

     -Y: Down +Y: Up

     -Z: Forward +Z: Backwards

     This is a unit vector and all inputs are normalized on a scale
     of 1/-1. Usually this vector only sees use in models that are on
     their side, and moving through a range of motion. Under these
     circumstances, something using the Forward vector could invert.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hold   This flag sets the position of the operation to remain constant
  Posi   at its originally calculated value.
  tion</p>

<p>Hold   This flag sets the rotation of the operation to remain constant
  Rota   at its originally calculated value.
  tion <br />
  ———————————————————————–</p>

<p>The two vector options are not typically used together. Mixing both
options will create a resulting rotation is equal to the Forward vector
rotation subtracted from the Up, which essentially splits the difference
in their rotations.</p>

<h2 id="using-an-explicit-rotation-operation">USING AN EXPLICIT ROTATION OPERATION</h2>

<p>You will now use an explicit rotation operation to reorient the light
model. Move back to the actors tab and create a new actor of the
‘Explicit Rotation’ type and name it ‘Light Offset.’ This procedure is
shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./067_Site_Operations_Rundown/image13.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Creating an Explicit Rotation Actor</p>

<p>You can set the exact rotation by selecting a vector type to base the
rotation on, then setting its x, y, and z fields. The possible vector
fields Forward and Up are shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./067_Site_Operations_Rundown/image14.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Rotation Actor Fields</p>

<p>Double clicking the Forward field will open the following view.</p>

<p><img src="./067_Site_Operations_Rundown/image15.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Setting Rotation Site Operation</p>

<p>The rotation required here is to swing the light to the left and
backwards a full unit each. You can do this by setting the X, and Y
fields to 1. Your operation is now complete and ready to be added to the
model actor’s site operations listing. You can do so by moving to the
‘Host Site Operations field in the ‘Marine Light’ and double clicking to
open it. From here, select ‘Choose’ again and navigate to the new ‘Light
Offset’ operation in the popup. Select it and click ‘Ok.’</p>

<p><img src="./067_Site_Operations_Rundown/image16.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Adding your Custom Explicit Rotation Site Operation</p>

<p>This will populate it into the site operation list as shown above. From
there, click ‘Ok’ to finish the addition. The operation is now complete
and can be investigated, but there’s one more change you should make.
Move to the ‘Scale Maximum’ field and open it. Set each of the X, Y, and
Z values to 0.25. Repeat this process for the ‘Scale Minimum’ field.</p>

<p><img src="./067_Site_Operations_Rundown/image17.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Adjusting the Light Posts Scale</p>

<p>On creation, models are set between the Scale Maximum and Scale Minimum.
Making the two fields equal to one another will provide constant,
non-random scaling for the model. These figures have set the scale to
roughly a fourth of what was seen before. You can check your progress by
returning to the Terrain Editor, where you should see something like the
image below.</p>

<p><img src="./067_Site_Operations_Rundown/image18.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Scaled and Rotated Model Attachment</p>

<p>Note that the main axis of the street light is now aligned with the
model’s head.</p>

<h2 id="site-operation-local-offset">SITE OPERATION (LOCAL OFFSET)</h2>

<p>The Local Offset site operation allows you to change the position of a
model in all three cardinal directions: x, y, and z.</p>

<hr />
<p>Field    Details
  ——– ————————————————————–
  Local    Applies an offset vector that moves the actor in three
  Offset   directions, X, Y, and Z. This vector follows the basic
           directionality of the Editor, which is as follows.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>       -X: Right +X: Left

       -Y: Forward +Y: Backwards

       -Z: Down +Z: Up
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hold     This flag sets the position of the offset to remain constant
  Positi   at its originally calculated value.
  on</p>

<p>Hold     This flag sets the rotation of the offset to remain constant
  Rotati   at its originally calculated value.
  on     <br />
  ———————————————————————–</p>

<h2 id="using-a-local-offset-operation">USING A LOCAL OFFSET OPERATION</h2>

<p>Now you’ll use an offset operation to do some tweaking on the light
attachment’s position. Create a new actor named ‘Light Down’ with the
type ‘Site Operation (Local Offset).’</p>

<p><img src="./067_Site_Operations_Rundown/image19.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Creating a Local Offset Actor</p>

<p>Move to your new actor’s Local Offset field. The model will be moved
downwards into the unit by offsetting it along the negative Z axis.
Double click the field to edit it and set Z value to -0.3.</p>

<p><img src="./067_Site_Operations_Rundown/image20.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Setting the Offset Actor’s Fields</p>

<p>As with the others, this site operation must be added to the Base
model’s actor events. Go to the ‘Host Site Operations field within
‘Marine Light’ and double click it to open the subeditor view. From
there, hit ‘Choose’ and add the ‘Local Down’ offset to the operations
listing. The listing, now containing three different site operations,
should appear as in the image below.</p>

<p><img src="./067_Site_Operations_Rundown/image21.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Offset Operation Added to Listing</p>

<p>Now is a good time to remember that the order of operations is
important, and that altering it will often cause unpredictable results.
Confirm that the operation order meets your planned design as in the
above image. At this point the project is complete. A foreign model has
been grafted onto the marine, reoriented, scaled, and offset. Move back
to the Terrain Editor and take a moment to appreciate your design.</p>

<p>Money Well Spent</p>
