<h1 id="mods">MODS</h1>

<p>Mods separate the assets of a game from a map file. As a result, they
can never be launched within StarCraft itself, only handled in the
Editor. Mods are eventually made usable by being placed within a map
file. The map’s requirement of these mod files is known as a dependency.
The advantage of this arrangement is easy to explain; separating game
data from map terrain allows a mod to be hosted within various different
maps. This means that a custom game mode can be ported to many
differently designed locations, whether for aesthetic or gameplay
reasons.</p>

<h2 id="mod-types">MOD TYPES</h2>

<p>Mod type is largely dictated by where the mods are being applied. There
are two groups. The more typical Dependent mods contain triggers, data,
and any type of non-terrain editor information. You can upload these
mods to Battle.net using the Editor. However, to make a full game, they
will eventually need to be added as a dependency to an active map within
the Editor. This design makes them a basic organization and utility
construct, ready for use in any map which would use custom data.</p>

<p>Extension mods similarly contain all types of game changing data and are
built within the Editor, but in contrast they are applied within the
‘Custom Games’ interface on Battle.net by selecting a base map, then an
extension mod. This allows a division of map and mod design. In this
way, mod makers can use maps in various capacities without the need for
explicit collaboration. Extension mods can also contain Dependent mod
dependencies, and as such can be thought of as an application of the
basic dependant mods.</p>

<p>Observer Interfaces are a special subclass of extension mods. These mods
can only make alterations to the UI segments of the Editor. This has
special applications in customizing the competitive spectating
experience of StarCraft matches. These interfaces can also be activated
for use in replay viewing.</p>

<h2 id="mod-usages">MOD USAGES</h2>

<p>Mods are useful for avoiding redundancy. Imagine you had designed a
custom campaign that carried special rules, characters, and player
decisions through a series of ten maps. Without the use of a mod, you
would have to replicate these custom rules for every single episode of
the campaign. By moving elements of the game into a data construct, a
mod, you eliminate the need to repeatedly rebuild maps.</p>

<p>The use of mods becomes even more crucial when you consider the
possibility of continued updates to your custom campaign. Without a
standard mod dependency, each update cycle will result in you needing to
make alterations to every single map. You might copy and paste data from
map to map for each update, but without the ability to control any of
these versions, the possibility of catastrophic failure looms large.
Mods will organize these changes and propagate them out to every single
map utilizing the mod, saving you significant effort.</p>

<p>Beyond this, mods make it possible for you to separate work on a project
by partitioning large portions of a game’s design into individual mods.
This allows multiple developers to collaborate on a single project, with
each working on different aspects of the project, such as cutscenes,
data, and terrain.</p>

<p>Mods are often used to bundle a lot of assets in order to streamline
play on Battle.net and the Arcade. Remember that in StarCraft files are
stored on the Battle.net servers, then downloaded and accessed locally.
If the mod portion of a project remains unchanged between versions of a
game, despite alterations to the rest of the game, players won’t need to
download those mods again. If used well, this can ease both the
development process and sharing games online. Supporting this, mod files
can reach a maximum of 100 MB, while maps have a maximum size of 20 MB.
This encourages smart data use and increases a map’s ability to use
custom assets.</p>
