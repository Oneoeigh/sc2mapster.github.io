<h1 id="publishing">PUBLISHING</h1>

<p>While projects made with the Editor can be played locally on a
single-player basis, most creators intend to share their work online.
Fortunately, Battle.net, Blizzard’s hosting platform for games, has been
extended to support developers working in the StarCraft engine. Gone are
the days when projects had to be shared through game hosting, as was the
case in WarCraft III and Brood War. Now, players can find and download
games without any intervention from developers. This free-standing
system also offers additional protection, version control, and
localization support for its users.</p>

<p>However, network-based project sharing requires a little more upfront
preparation from game developers. This preparation comes in the form of
new publishing systems in the Editor. You can find them by navigating to
File -&gt; Publish, which launches the ‘Publish Document’ window, pictured
below.</p>

<p><img src="./016_Publishing/image1.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Publish Document Window</p>

<p>The first screen you’ll be presented with is the ‘Log In’ view, note the
‘Verification’ field, which mentions the publishing status. As you can
see, the user cannot progress as they are ‘Not Logged in to Battle.net.’
In order to publish, you’ll need a Battle.net account with a full
version of StarCraft II attached to it. The Editor itself is provided
with the StarCraft II: Starter Edition, but free users cannot publish
online. That functionality can be acquired with any version of a
StarCraft II account, including the standalone games.</p>

<p>If you click the the ‘Log In’ button, you’ll be prompted to enter your
account name and password.</p>

<p><img src="./016_Publishing/image2.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Battle.net Log In Window</p>

<p>Enter your account email and password here, then select ‘Connect.’ If
you have an authenticator associated with your account, another window
will prompt you for your authenticator code. If you intend to publish
often, you may want to make use of the ‘Remember Account’ toggle, which
could save you a lot of time.</p>

<p>Once you’ve logged in and returned to the main screen, the
‘Verification’ should show a more encouraging ‘Ready to Publish’
message. You should also find that the ‘Next’ button is now usable.
Before moving on, note the controls for ‘Publish to Regions.’ These are
convenience options that allow your project to be published to multiple
regions at once without requiring you to log in again.</p>

<h2 id="publishing-requirements">PUBLISHING REQUIREMENTS</h2>

<p>Selecting ‘Next’ from the ‘Log In’ window will send you to the main
publishing view, ‘Configure Options.’ Before a game can be hosted on
Battle.net, it must meet a number of requirements. This screen gives you
several options for prepping a project for upload, but the most
important are the publishing requirements in the bottommost subview. If
your project fails to meet any of these requirements, the ‘Verification’
field will read ‘Unable to publish due to problems below,’ as shown in
the following image.</p>

<p><img src="./016_Publishing/image3.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Publishing Options Window</p>

<p>The publishing requirements are usually small logistical issues
requiring clarification before upload. Below you will find a table
detailing some of the most common issues and their resolutions. Some of
the options mentioned in these resolutions will be described in more
detail in the following section.</p>

<hr />

               Be warned that this method will result in the project

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once all publishing requirements have been met, the ‘Verification’ field
will show ‘Ready to Publish!’</p>

<h2 id="publishing-options">PUBLISHING OPTIONS</h2>

<p>‘Configure Options’ consists of a number of options designed to prepare
a map for publication, as well as resolving requirement issues before
upload. See below for a detailed breakdown.</p>

<hr />
<p>Field             Details
  —————– —————————————————————-
  Published Name    The publishing name for the project. This is the name used
                    online, by default it is set to the project name set in ‘Map
                    Info.’ You can change this using the Change Name button.</p>

<p>Locale            Selects the localization version for publishing.</p>

<p>Revision          Increments the automatically generated ‘Version’ field. Major
                    releases increment the value by 1.0, while Minor versions
                    increment by 0.1. Revision is tied to the publishing name. Every
                    time the name changes, the value is reset back to the default
                    0.0.</p>

<p>Release           Sets the game’s accessibility. Private requires the uploader to
                    host, and requires manual invites for each player. Public allows
                    anyone to host.</p>

<p>Author            Uses your Battle.net ID to list authorship. If Use Real Name is
                    selected, the name of your Blizzard Account will be appended.</p>

<p>Locked/Unlocked   The lock status refers to the availability of source project.
  Mode              Unlocked maps can be downloaded within the Editor by any
                    developer. Setting Locked removes the source from public
                    availability.
  ———————————————————————————-</p>

<p>Take care when considering the Locked and Unlocked statuses. The former
will properly protect your map from every developer, including yourself.
If you lose your files with this status selected, your project will
remain online with no way to recover it. Setting your project to
Unlocked remedies this, and also allows you to share your project with
other developers, assisting in the growth of collaborative knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="file-management">FILE MANAGEMENT</h2>

<p>After each project option is configured and all requirements have been
met, you can click ‘Next’ to arrive at the ‘Storage Requirements’ view.
This gives you a breakdown of the space your file takes up, as well as
size limits on your project.</p>

<p><img src="./016_Publishing/image4.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Storage Requirements View</p>

<p>Every Battle.net account is allotted the following storage provisions:
20 concurrently uploaded files, 157 MB of total uploads, and a maximum
individual upload size of 20 MB for maps and 100 MB for mods. These
limits are not shared between regions. If you are approaching any of
these limits, you can select ‘Manage Files’ to make changes to your
current uploads. You will be brought to the ‘Manage Published Files’
window shown below.</p>

<p><img src="./016_Publishing/image5.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Published Files Manager</p>

<p>This screen shows all projects currently uploaded to your account,
listing their Locked status, Release, Version, and Size. Highlighting a
project will reveal its full details. Any published project can be
deleted from Battle.net. If you need to free up space, you can do so
using the ‘Remove From Account’ button. Once you have finished, close
the window and publish by clicking ‘OK’ in the ‘Check Storage
Requirements’ view. You will be presented with a pop-up containing the
EULA and TOU agreements.</p>

<p><img src="./016_Publishing/image6.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Compliance Check</p>

<p>Once you have confirmed your compliance with the agreements, click ‘Yes’
to publish.</p>
