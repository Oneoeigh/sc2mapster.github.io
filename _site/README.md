## Welcome to the SC2Mapster Community Github Site

The goal for this site is to provide some more indepth guides for map and mode development on StarCraft II. Most of the guides here will aim to elaborate how you can work with the plain text data formats the game uses, along some other complex parts of the Galaxy Editor. There will be tools and references that will make your life easier.

If you wish to contribute, drop a line over the [Issues](https://github.com/SC2Mapster/sc2mapster.github.io/issues) section of the team page, and we will be willing to either make you part of the team or include guides you write (full credit of course).
